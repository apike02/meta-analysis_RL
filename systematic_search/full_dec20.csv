Previous research suggests disclosure, lack of staff knowledge and poor communication between University and placement sites may be relevant, but these are limited to small case studies with students with visual or physical disabilities. The purpose of this study was to explore disabled physiotherapy students' experiences of their education in order to elucidate factors that may influence success. Methods Qualitative study drawing on phenomenological traditions. Four focus groups including 15 students with disabilities were conducted. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Procedures for transparency and rigour such as member checking and peer debriefing were implemented. Results Three major themes were derived from data. It was quite a relief explores the personal and social implications of diagnosis. They're not natural focuses on academic assessment and the specifics of adjustments made and not made within that context. My dyslexia doesn't switch off explores the inaccessibility of the learning environment and dissects the contrast between the 24-h nature of having a specific learning condition and the somewhat piecemeal nature of adjustments during their education. Conclusions This study indicates that having a specific learning disability or anxiety creates a number of hurdles to success in physiotherapy education. Most were within the University setting and were perceived to result from staff ignorance or piecemeal approaches to inclusion. A lack of consistency alongside facilitated dialogue and acknowledgement of enhancements results in frustration, ambiguity towards disclosure and reinforcement of a deficit model.

We analyzed reinforcement-based decision making in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) to identify the specific decision mechanisms contributing to poorer performance. Individuals with MDD (n = 64) and matched healthy controls (n = 64) performed a probabilistic reversal-learning task in which they used feedback to identify which of two stimuli had the highest probability of reward (reward condition) or lowest probability of punishment (punishment condition). Learning differences were characterized using a hierarchical Bayesian reinforcement learning model. Depressed individuals made fewer optimal choices and adjusted more slowly to reversals in both the reward and punishment conditions. Computational modeling revealed that depressed individuals showed lower learning-rates and, to a lesser extent, lower value sensitivity in both the reward and punishment conditions. Learning-rates also predicted depression more accurately than simple performance metrics. These results demonstrate that depression is characterized by a hyposensitivity to positive outcomes, but not a hypersensitivity to negative outcomes.

This study was designed to test whether lithium administration may stabilize mood via effects on reward processing. It was hypothesized that lithium administration would modulate reward processing in the striatum and affect both anticipation and outcome computations. Thirty-seven healthy human participants (18 males, 33 with suitable fMRI data) received 11 (+/- 1) days of lithium carbonate or placebo intervention (double-blind), after which they completed the monetary incentive delay task while fMRI data were collected. The monetary incentive delay task is a robust task with excellent test-retest reliability and is well suited to investigate different phases of reward processing within the caudate and nucleus accumbens. To test for correlations with prediction error signals a Rescorla-Wagner reinforcement-learning model was applied. Lithium administration enhanced activity in the caudate during reward anticipation compared to placebo. In contrast, lithium administration reduced caudate and nucleus accumbens activity during reward outcome. This latter effect seems related to learning as reward prediction errors showed a positive correlation with caudate and nucleus accumbens activity during placebo, which was absent after lithium administration. Lithium differentially modulates the anticipation relative to the learning of rewards. This suggests that lithium might reverse dampened reward anticipation while reducing overactive reward updating in patients with bipolar disorder.

Computational work suggests that these biases may stem from a belief that negative events have a higher information content than positive events, resulting in preferential processing of and learning from negative outcomes. Learning biases therefore represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions. In this proof-of-concept study in healthy volunteers, we assessed the malleability of biased reinforcement learning using a novel cognitive training paradigm and concurrent transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Methods In two studies, young healthy adults completed two sessions of negative (n = 20) or positive (n = 20) training designed to selectively increase learning from loss or win outcomes, respectively. During training active or sham tDCS was applied bilaterally to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Analyses tested for changes both in learning rates and win- and loss-driven behaviour. Potential positive/negative emotional transfer of win/loss learning was assessed by a facial emotion recognition task and mood questionnaires. Results Negative and positive training increased learning rates for losses and wins, respectively. With negative training, there was also a trend for win (but not loss) learning rates to decrease over successive task blocks. After negative training, there was evidence for near transfer in the form of an increase in loss-driven choices when participants performed a similar (untrained) task. There was no change in far transfer measures of emotional face processing or mood. tDCS had no effect on any aspect of behaviour. Discussion and Conclusions Negative training induced a mild negative bias in healthy adults as reflected in loss-driven choice behaviour. Prefrontal tDCS had no effect.

Theory and Study Protocol for App-Based Anxiety Program,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,"Objective: Anxiety is associated with sleep disturbance and insomnia. Mindfulness-based interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, have shown consistent anxiety reduction. Mindfulness training has been theorized to affect reinforcement learning, affecting habitual behaviors such as smoking and overeating, but a direct mechanistic link between the use of mindfulness training for anxiety reduction and improvement in sleep has not been studied. Moreover, the mechanisms by which mindfulness might affect worry and subsequent sleep disturbances have not been elucidated. This study protocol evaluates the impact an app-based mindfulness training program for anxiety might have on decreasing worry and improvement in sleep. Method: A randomized controlled study will be conducted in approximately 80 adults with worry that interferes with their sleep. Participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to two groups: treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU + App-Based Mindfulness Training (Unwinding Anxiety app). The primary outcomes will be the non-reactivity subscale of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System sleep quality measures (Baer et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2011).

Discussion: This study will be the first to test the mechanism of app-based mindfulness training on worry and sleep disturbance. Testing the mechanistic effects of mindfulness training using the science of behavior change framework will help move the field forward both in further elucidation of potential mechanisms of mindfulness (e.g., targeting reinforcement learning) and determining whether such a platform might be a viable method for delivering high-fidelity treatment at scale and for a low cost.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0278-6133,1930-7810,,NA,NA,SEP,2020,39,9,NA,,SI,,776,784,,10.1037/hea0000874,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000563083500006,32833479,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Individuals differ remarkably in their tendency to acquire and perform new avoidance behaviors, as seen in anxiety disorders where avoidance becomes pervasive and inappropriate. In rodent models of avoidance, the inbred Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat demonstrates increased learning and expression of avoidance compared to the outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) rat. However, underlying mechanisms that contribute to these differences are unclear. Computational modeling techniques can help identify factors that may not be easily decipherable from behavioral data alone. Here, we utilize a reinforcement learning (RL) model approach to better understand strain differences in avoidance behavior. An actor-critic model, with separate learning rates for action selection (in the actor) and state evaluation (in the critic), was applied to individual data of avoidance acquisition from a large cohort of WKY and SD rats. Latent parameters were extracted, such as learning rate and subjective reinforcement value of foot shock, that were then compared across groups. The RL model was able to accurately represent WKY and SD avoidance behavior, demonstrating that the model could simulate individual performance. The model determined that the perceived negative value of foot shock was significantly higher in WKY than SD rats, whereas learning rate in the actor was lower in WKY than SD rats.

The Emotional Reversal Learning Task (ERLT) was designed to investigate this, and we examined its construct validity by inducing social rejection, an etiological process of depression, within the ERLT model. We expected excluded participants to have difficulty disengaging from NSP. Methods: We administered Cyberball to 130 participants randomly assigned to the excluded or included condition. Participants then completed the ERLT: They chose a valence option (positive or negative), retrieved a memory of the same valence, and then were rewarded or punished for their valence choice. For the first phase, retrieving a negative memory was probabilistically rewarded, and this action-outcome contingency was twice reversed during the task. We used Q-learning models to analyze learning rates. Results: Excluded participants had no more difficulty disengaging from NSP than included participants: Bayesian computational modeling identified no difference between conditions regarding learning that retrieving negative memories was punished. Exploratory analyses found that excluded participants learned the association between retrieving positive memories and reward quicker than included participants, however. Limitations: Doubts remain regarding whether participants fully understood action-outcome contingencies, and we did not explicitly check whether participants truly retrieved memories, which could have affected results.

Recent work has studied the effects of uncertainty on individuals expressing behavioral inhibition (BI). The current study extended this work with uncertainty to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats which are a behaviorally inhibited inbred strain that models learning vulnerabilities for anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). WKY rats exhibit superior avoidance performance in a signaled bar press avoidance task in which a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) signals a foot shock unconditional stimulus (US) when compared with non-inhibited Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. In addition, WKY rats express enhanced eyeblink conditioning. Recent work with behaviorally inhibited humans has indicated that this enhanced eyeblink conditioning is more evident in conditions that insert CS- or US-alone trials into CS-US paired training, resulting in uncertain and suboptimal learning conditions. The current study examined the effects of partial predictability training, in which the CS signaled the US only one-half of the time, on the acquisition and expression of avoidance. Standard training with a fixed 60-s CS which predicted shock on 100% of trials was compared with training in which the CS predicted shock on 50% of trials (partial predictability) using a pseudorandom schedule. As expected, WKY rats acquired avoidance responses faster and to a greater degree than SD rats. Partial predictability of the US essentially reduced SD rats to escape responding. Partial predictability also reduced avoidance in WKY rats; however, adjusting avoidance rates for the number of potential pairings of the CS and US early in training suggested a similar degree of avoidance expression late in the last session of training. Enhanced active avoidance expression, even in uncertain learning conditions, can be interpreted as behaviorally inhibited WKY rats responding to the expectancy of the shock by avoiding, whereas non-inhibited SD rats were responding to the presence of the shock by escaping. Future work should explore how WKY and SD rats as well as behaviorally inhibited humans acquire and extinguish avoidance responses in uncertain learning situations.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-0640,,,NA,NA,Aug-19,2020,11,,NA,,,,,,848,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00848,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000566189900001,32973587,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: In all, 52 university students were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. To manipulate interoception, the participants in the experimental group were instructed to tune their internal somatic sense to the skin-conductance-response waveform presented on a display. The participants in the control group were only instructed to stay relaxed. Before and after the manipulation, the participants completed a probabilistic reversal-learning task to assess reward-based decision-making using reinforcement learning modeling. Similarly, participants completed a probe-detection task, a heartbeat-detection task, and self-rated scales. Results: The experimental manipulation of interoception was not successful.

However, when threat becomes overwhelming, it may be deleterious to mental health, especially for vulnerable individuals. Flexible decision-making was probed with a reward reversal task to investigate how well healthy participants (N = 34) can adapt to changes in reward contingency when they expect adverse events (i.e., electric shocks). In comparison to a safe control condition, the threat of shock significantly impaired reward reversal learning. Moreover, enhanced self-reported threat ratings and elevated skin conductance levels support the successful induction of stressful and aversive apprehensions. The findings are in line with literature showing the stress-induced inhibition of goal-directed behavior at the advantage of a reflexive (habitual) response style. Notably, reversal learning was rapidly restored with the omission of threat through several cycles of threat and safety contexts within one experimental session. These results extend the literature and illuminate the immediate consequence of a sustained threatening stressor (and its removal) on decision-making.

In this article, we propose a novel domain adaptation method to generalize the emotion recognition models across subjects and sessions. We use neural networks to implement the emotion recognition models, which are optimized by minimizing the classification error on the source while making the source and the target similar in their latent representations. Considering the functional differences of the network layers, we use adversarial training to adapt the marginal distributions in the early layers and perform association reinforcement to adapt the conditional distributions in the last layers. In this way, we approximately adapt the joint distributions by simultaneously adapting marginal distributions and conditional distributions.

Over the past decade evidence has accumulated from case-control studies that depressive illness is associated with blunted reward activation in the basal ganglia and other regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex. However it is unclear whether this finding can be replicated in a large number of subjects. The functional anatomy of the medial prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia has been extensively studied and the former has excitatory glutamatergic projections to the latter. Reduced effect of glutamatergic projections from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens has been argued to underlie motivational disorders such as depression, and many prominent theories of major depressive disorder propose a role for abnormal cortico-limbic connectivity. However, it is unclear whether there is abnormal reward-linked effective connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia related to depression. While resting state connectivity abnormalities have been frequently reported in depression, it has not been possible to directly link these findings to reward-learning studies. Here, we tested two main hypotheses. First, mood symptoms are associated with blunted striatal reward prediction error signals in a large community-based sample of recovered and currently ill patients, similar to reports from a number of studies. Second, event-related directed medial prefrontal cortex to basal ganglia effective connectivity is abnormally increased or decreased related to the severity of mood symptoms. Using a Research Domain Criteria approach, data were acquired from a large community-based sample of subjects who participated in a probabilistic reward learning task during event-related functional MRI. Computational modelling of behaviour, model-free and model-based functional MRI, and effective connectivity dynamic causal modelling analyses were used to test hypotheses. Increased depressive symptom severity was related to decreased reward signals in areas which included the nucleus accumbens in 475 participants. Decreased rewardrelated effective connectivity from the medial prefrontal cortex to striatum was associated with increased depressive symptom severity in 165 participants. Decreased striatal activity may have been due to decreased cortical to striatal connectivity consistent with glutamatergic and cortical-limbic related theories of depression and resulted in reduced direct pathway basal ganglia output. Further study of basal ganglia pathophysiology is required to better understand these abnormalities in patients with depressive symptoms and syndromes.",NA,NA,NA,"Shen, Xueyi/AAS-8960-2020","Shen, Xueyi/0000-0002-0538-4774; Rupprechter, Samuel/0000-0002-8708-1928; Lawrie, Stephen/0000-0002-2444-5675; Steele, J Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Waiter, Gordon/0000-0002-5313-9845; Sandu, Anca-Larisa/0000-0002-5555-4129; Murray, Alison/0000-0003-4915-4847",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0006-8950,1460-2156,,NA,NA,JUN,2020,143,,6,,,,1946,1956,,10.1093/brain/awaa106,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000541788700035,32385498,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32385498,"Rupprechter S, Romaniuk L, Series P, Hirose Y, Hawkins E, Sandu AL, Waiter GD, McNeil CJ, Shen X, Harris MA, Campbell A, Porteous D, Macfarlane JA, Lawrie SM, Murray AD, Delgado MR, McIntosh AM, Whalley HC, Steele JD.",Brain. 2020 Jun 1;143(6):1946-1956. doi: 10.1093/brain/awaa106.,Rupprechter S,Brain,2020,10/05/2020,PMC7296844,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Complicated learned strategies including contextual contents are involved in making aversive prediction errors during the learning process.

We hypothesised that we could reproduce the experimental risk taking behaviour using a model of the basal ganglia under conditions where cortico-striatal plasticity was abnormal. As dopamine exerts opposing effects on cortico-striatal plasticity via different receptors expressed on medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the direct (D1R dominant, dMSNs) and indirect (D2R dominant, iMSNs) pathways, we tested whether abnormalities in cortico-striatal plasticity in one or both of these pathways could explain the patient's behaviour. Our model could generate simulated behaviour indistinguishable from patients when cortico-striatal plasticity was abnormal in both dMSNs and iMSNs in opposite directions. The risk neutral behaviour of the patients was replicated when increased cortico-striatal long term potentiation in dMSN's was in combination with increased long term depression in iMSN's. This result is consistent with previous observations in rodent models of increased cortico-striatal plasticity at in dMSNs, but contrasts with the pattern reported in vitro of dopamine D2 receptor dependant increases in cortico-striatal LTP and loss of LTD at iMSNs.

There is a growing desire to understand the mechanisms by which such therapies effect change so as to improve treatment outcomes. Here we argue that adopting a computational framework may be one such approach. Computational psychiatry aims to provide a theoretical framework for moving between higher-level psychological states (like emotions, decisions and beliefs) to neural circuits, by modeling these constructs mathematically. These models are explicit hypotheses that contain quantifiable variables and parameters derived from each individual's behavior. This approach has two advantages. Firstly, some of the variables described by these models appears to reflect the neural activity of specific brain regions.

Computational models of ARDM have been implemented primarily as state-dependent reinforcement learning models with bias parameters to quantify Pavlovian associations, and differential learning rates to quantify instrumental updating have been shown to depend on context, involve complex cost calculations, and include the consideration of counterfactual outcomes. Little is known about how individual differences influence these models relevant to anxiety-related conditions or addiction-related dysfunction. It is argued that model parameters reflecting 1) Pavlovian biases in the context of reinforcement learning or 2) hyperprecise prior beliefs in the context of active inference play an important role in the emergence of dysfunctional avoidance behaviors. The neural implementation of ARDM includes brain areas that are important for valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and positive reinforcement-related prediction errors (ventral striatum), but also aversive processing (insular cortex and cerebellum). Computational models of ARDM will help to establish a quantitative explanatory account of the development of anxiety disorders and addiction, but such models also face several challenges, including limited evidence for stability of individual differences, relatively low reliability of tasks, and disorder heterogeneity.

However, they also engage the brain systems for stress and pain (somatic and emotional) while producing hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia, which drive pronounced drug-seeking behavior via processes of negative reinforcement. Hyperkatifeia (derived from the Greek katifeia for dejection or negative emotional state) is defined as an increase in intensity of the constellation of negative emotional or motivational signs and symptoms of withdrawal from drugs of abuse. In animal models, repeated extended access to drugs or opioids results in negative emotion-like states, reflected by the elevation of reward thresholds, lower pain thresholds, anxiety-like behavior, and dysphoric-like responses. Such negative emotional states that drive negative reinforcement are hypothesized to derive from the within-system dysregulation of key neurochemical circuits that mediate incentive-salience and/or reward systems (dopamine, opioid peptides) in the ventral striatum and from the between-system recruitment of brain stress systems (corticotropin-releasing factor, dynorphin, norepinephrine, hypocretin, vasopressin, glucocorticoids, and neuroimmune factors) in the extended amygdala. Hyperkatifeia can extend into protracted abstinence and interact with learning processes in the form of conditioned withdrawal to facilitate relapse to compulsive-like drug seeking. Compelling evidence indicates that plasticity in the brain pain emotional systems is triggered by acute excessive drug intake and becomes sensitized during the development of compulsive drug taking with repeated withdrawal.

However, the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects of self-administered drugs on behavioral flexibility are not well understood. To investigate whether drug exposure causes asymmetric effects on positive and negative outcomes we used a reversal learning procedure to assess how reward contingencies are utilized to guide behavior in rats previously exposed to intravenous cocaine self-administration (SA). Twenty-four rats were screened for anxiety in an open field prior to acquisition of cocaine SA over six daily sessions with subsequent long-access cocaine SA for 7 days. Control rats (n = 24) were trained to lever-press for food under a yoked schedule of reinforcement. Higher rates of cocaine SA were predicted by increased anxiety and preceded impaired reversal learning, expressed by a decrease in lose-shift as opposed to win-stay probability. A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm revealed that rats with high, but not low cocaine escalation failed to exploit previous reward learning and were more likely to repeat the same response as the previous trial. Eight-day withdrawal from high cocaine escalation was associated, respectively, with increased and decreased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) expression in the ventral striatum compared with controls. Dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) expression was also significantly reduced in the orbitofrontal cortex of high cocaine-escalating rats.

AbstractThe emerging research field of so-called computational psychiatry attempts to contribute to an understanding of complex psychiatric phenomena by applying computational methods and to promote the translation of neuroscientific research results into clinical practice. This article presents this field of research using selected examples based on the distinction between data-driven and theory-driven approaches. Exemplary for a data-driven approach are studies to predict clinical outcome, for example, in persons with a high-risk state for psychosis or on the response to pharmacological treatment for depression. Theory-driven approaches attempt to describe the mechanisms of altered information processing as the cause of psychiatric symptoms at the behavioral and neuronal level. In computational models possible mechanisms can be described that may have produced the measured behavioral or neuronal data. For example, in schizophrenia patients the clinical phenomenon of aberrant salience has been described as learning irrelevant information or cognitive deficits have been linked to connectivity changes in frontoparietal networks. Computational psychiatry can make important contributions to the prediction of individual clinical courses as well as to a mechanistic understanding of psychiatric symptoms.

During reward learning, cAMP production is crucial for strengthening the synapses from cortical neurons onto the striatal principal neurons, and its formation is dependent on several neuromodulatory systems such as dopamine and acetylcholine. It is, however, not understood how AC5 is activated by transient (subsecond) changes in the neuromodulatory signals. Here we combine several computational tools, from molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations to bioinformatics approaches, to inform and constrain a kinetic model of the AC5-dependent signaling system. We use this model to show how the specific molecular properties of AC5 can detect particular combinations of co-occuring transient changes in the neuromodulatory signals which thus result in a supralinear/synergistic cAMP production. Our results also provide insights into the computational capabilities of the different AC isoforms. Long-term potentiation and depression of synaptic activity in response to stimuli is a key factor in reinforcement learning. Strengthening of the corticostriatal synapses depends on the second messenger cAMP, whose synthesis is catalysed by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase 5 (AC5), which is itself regulated by the stimulatory G alpha(olf) and inhibitory G alpha(i) proteins. AC isoforms have been suggested to act as coincidence detectors, promoting cellular responses only when convergent regulatory signals occur close in time. However, the mechanism for this is currently unclear, and seems to lie in their diverse regulation patterns. Despite attempts to isolate the ternary complex, it is not known if G alpha(olf) and G alpha(i) can bind to AC5 simultaneously, nor what activity the complex would have. Using protein structure-based molecular dynamics simulations, we show that this complex is stable and inactive. These simulations, along with Brownian dynamics simulations to estimate protein association rates constants, constrain a kinetic model that shows that the presence of this ternary inactive complex is crucial for AC5's ability to detect coincident signals, producing a synergistic increase in cAMP. These results reveal some of the prerequisites for corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, and explain recent experimental data on cAMP concentrations following receptor activation. Moreover, they provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control signal processing by different AC isoforms.",NA,NA,NA,"Bruce, Neil J/E-8455-2012","Bruce, Neil J/0000-0002-2735-3215; Nair, Anu/0000-0002-1952-9583; Hellgren Kotaleski, Jeanette/0000-0002-0550-0739; Narzi, Daniele/0000-0003-2731-6286; Carloni, Paolo/0000-0002-9010-0149; Wade, Rebecca/0000-0001-5951-8670",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1553-734X,1553-7358,,NA,NA,OCT,2019,15,10,NA,,,,,,e1007382,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007382,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000500776600040,31665146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Neurocircuitry models posit that increased risk is mediated by heightened emotion processing in a salience network including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and amygdala. However, the processes of reinforcement learning (RL) also engage the salience network and are implicated in responses to early-life trauma and PTSD. To define their relative roles in response to early-life trauma and PTSD symptoms, the current study compared engagement of the salience network during emotion processing and RL as a function of early-life assault exposure. METHODS: Adolescent girls (n = 30 girls who had previously been physically or sexually assaulted; n = 30 healthy girls for comparison) 11 to 17 years of age completed two types of tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging: a facial emotion processing task and an RL task using either social or nonsocial stimuli. Independent component analysis was used to identify a salience network and characterize its engagement in response to emotion processing and prediction error encoding during the RL tasks. RESULTS: Assault was related to greater reactivity of the salience network during emotion processing. By contrast, we found lesser encoding of negative prediction errors in the salience network, particularly during the social RL task, in girls who had been assaulted. The dysfunction of salience network activity during emotion processing and prediction error encoding was not associated with PTSD symptoms.

The mechanisms that underlie probability-magnitude integration deficits, however, are poorly understood. We hypothesized that increased reliance on valueless stimulus-response associations, in lieu of expected value (EV)-based learning, could drive probability-magnitude integration deficits in PSZ with motivational deficits. METHODS: Healthy volunteers (n = 38) and PSZ (n = 49) completed a learning paradigm consisting of four stimulus pairs. Reward magnitude (3, 2, 1, 0 points) and probability (90%, 80%, 20%, 10%) determined each stimulus's EV. Following a learning phase, new and familiar stimulus pairings were presented. Participants were asked to select stimuli with the highest reward value. RESULTS: PSZ with high motivational deficits made increasingly less optimal choices as the difference in reward value (probability X magnitude) between two competing stimuli increased. Using a previously validated computational hybrid model, PSZ relied less on EV (Q-learning) and more on stimulus-response learning (actor-critic), which correlated with Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms motivational deficit severity. PSZ specifically failed to represent reward magnitude, consistent with model demonstrations showing that response tendencies in the actor-critic were preferentially driven by reward probability. CONCLUSIONS: Probability-magnitude deficits in PSZ with motivational deficits arise from underutilization of EV in favor of reliance on valueless stimulus-response associations. Confirmed by our computational hybrid framework, probability-magnitude integration deficits were driven specifically by a failure to represent reward magnitude.

Guided by computational frameworks, we formulated and tested two scenarios in which maladaptive representations of expected value should be most evident, thereby delineating conditions that may evoke decision-making impairments in schizophrenia. METHODS: In a modified reinforcement learning paradigm, 42 medicated people with schizophrenia and 36 healthy volunteers learned to select the most frequently rewarded option in a 75-25 pair: once when presented with a more deterministic (90-10) pair and once when presented with a more probabilistic (60-40) pair. Novel and old combinations of choice options were presented in a subsequent transfer phase. Computational modeling was employed to elucidate contributions from stimulus-response systems (actor-critic) and expected value (Q-learning). RESULTS: People with schizophrenia showed robust performance impairments with increasing value difference between two competing options, which strongly correlated with decreased contributions from expected value-based learning (Q-learning). Moreover, a subtle yet consistent contextual choice bias for the probabilistic 75 option was present in people with schizophrenia, which could be accounted for by a context-dependent reward prediction error in the actor-critic. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that decision-making impairments in schizophrenia increase monotonically with demands placed on expected value computations. A contextual choice bias is consistent with overreliance on stimulus-response learning, which may signify a deficit secondary to the maladaptive representation of expected value.

Here we describe how the platform might be used as a simulation, test, and diagnostic paradigm for psychiatric conditions. METHODS: To illustrate how active inference models of game play could be used to test mechanistic and algorithmic properties of psychiatric disorders, we provide two exemplar analyses. The first speaks to the impact of aging on cognition, examining game-play behaviors in a model of aging in which we compared age-dependent changes of younger (n = 9, 22 +/- 1 years of age) and older (n = 7, 56 +/- 5 years of age) adult players. The second is an illustration of a putative feature of anhedonia in which we simulated diminished sensitivity to reward. RESULTS: These simulations demonstrate how active inference can be used to test predicted changes in both neurobiology and beliefs in psychiatric cohorts. We show that, as well as behavioral measures, putative neural correlates of active inference can be simulated, and hypothesized (model-based) differences in local field potentials and blood oxygen level-dependent responses can be produced.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as long-term depression (LTD) are the major cellular models which could underlie learning and memory formation. LTP and LTD consist of at least two phases, an early protein synthesis-independent transient stage (<4 h; E-LTP, E-LTD) as well as a prolonged phase (>4 h; L-LTP, L-LTD) requiring the synthesis of new proteins. It is known that during E-LTP the further induction of longer lasting LTP is precluded. However, if E-LTP is transformed into L-LTP, the same synapses now allow the induction of LTP again. We reproduced the LTP-results first and then investigated whether hippocampal LTP or LTD also prevents the establishment of subsequent LTD-induction in the same synaptic input. We show that the prior induction of LTP or LTD does not prevent a short-term depression (STD) but occludes LTD in apical dendrites of CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices in vitro during the early phase of LIP or LTD. However, LTD can again be induced in addition to STD after the establishment of L-LTP or L-LTD, that is about 4 h after the induction of the first event in the same synaptic input. We suggest that the neuronal input preserves the capacity for STD immediately after an initial potentiation or depression, but for the onset of additional longer lasting LTD in the same synaptic input, the establishment of the late plasticity form of the preceding event is critical.

Accurate treatment of microcircuit pathways is especially critical for creating models that correctly predict the outcomes of candidate neurological therapies. Recent models are trying to specify how cortical circuits that enable planning and Voluntary actions interact with adaptive subcortical microcircuits in the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are strongly implicated in reinforcement learning, and in all behavior and cognition over which the frontal lobes exert flexible control. The persisting role of the basal ganglia shows that ancient vertebrate designs for motivated action selection proved adaptable enough to support many modern behavioral innovations, including fluent generation of language and speech. This paper summarizes how recent models have incorporated realistic representations of microcircuit features, and have begun to trace their computational implications. Also summarized are recent empirical discoveries that provide guidance regarding how to formulate the rules for synaptic modification that govern learning in cortico-striatal pathways. Such efforts are contributing to an emerging synthesis based on an interlocking set of computational hypotheses regarding cortical interactions with basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. These hypotheses specify how specialized microcircuits solve learning and control problems inherent to the brain's parallel design. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Neuroscience paradigms for approach-avoidance process theories of personality,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,"Reinforcement sensitivity is a concept proposed by Gray (1973) to describe the biological antecedents of personality, and has become the common mechanism among a family of personality theories concerning approach and avoidance processes. These theories suggest that 2-3 biobehavioural systems mediate the effects of reward and punishment on emotion and motivation, and that individual differences in the functioning of these systems manifest as personality identifying paradigms for operationalising reinforcement sensitivity is therefore critical for testing and developing these theories, and evaluating their footprint in personality space. In this paper I suggest that, while traditional self-report paradigms in personality psychology may be less-than-ideal for this purpose, neuroscience paradigms may offer operations of reinforcement sensitivity at multiple levels of approach and avoidance processes. After brief reflection on the use of such methods in animal models-which first spawned the concept of reinforcement sensitivity-recent developments in four domains of neuroscience are reviewed. These are psychogenomics, psychopharmacology, neuroimaging and category-learning. By exploring these paradigms as potential operations of reinforcement sensitivity we may enrich our understanding of the putative biobehavioural bases of personality.

In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.",NA,NA,NA,"Diesmann, Markus/H-3722-2013; Morrison, Abigail/H-9996-2013","Diesmann, Markus/0000-0002-2308-5727; Morrison, Abigail/0000-0001-6933-797X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0340-1200,1432-0770,,NA,NA,JUN,2008,98,6,NA,,,,459,478,,10.1007/s00422-008-0233-1,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000256079900003,18491160,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we show that the modulation of STDP by a global reward signal leads to reinforcement learning. We first derive analytically learning rules involving reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent synaptic and intrinsic plasticity, by applying a reinforcement learning algorithm to the stochastic spike response model of spiking neurons. These rules have several features common to plasticity mechanisms experimentally found in the brain. We then demonstrate in simulations of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons the efficacy of two simple learning rules involving modulated STDP. One rule is a direct extension of the standard STDP model (modulated STDP), and the other one involves an eligibility trace stored at each synapse that keeps a decaying, memory of the relationships between the recent pairs of preand postsynaptic spike pairs (modulated STDP with eligibility trace). This latter rule permits learning even if the reward signal is delayed. The proposed rules are able to solve the XOR problem with both ratecoded and temporally coded input and to learn a target output firing-rate pattern. These learning rules are biologically plausible, may be used for training generic artificial spiking neural networks, regardless of the neural model used, and suggest the experimental investigation in animals of the existence of reward-modulated STDP.",NA,NA,NA,"Florian, Razvan Valentin/I-7321-2019; Florian, Razvan/A-1033-2010","Florian, Razvan Valentin/0000-0002-4181-4727; Florian, Razvan/0000-0002-4181-4727",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0899-7667,1530-888X,,NA,NA,JUN,2007,19,6,NA,,,,1468,1502,,10.1162/neco.2007.19.6.1468,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000246262300002,17444757,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The prefrontal cortex appears to mediate many aspects of goal-directed decision making. This article presents a model of prefrontal cortex function emphasizing the influence of goal-related activity on the choice of the next motor output. The model can be interpreted in terms of key elements of Reinforcement Learning Theory. Different neocortical minicolumns represent distinct sensory input states and distinct motor output actions. The dynamics of each minicolumn include separate phases of encoding and retrieval. During encoding, strengthening of excitatory connections forms forward and reverse associations between each state, the following action, and a subsequent state, which may include reward. During retrieval, activity spreads from reward states throughout the network. The interaction of this spreading activity with a specific input state directs selection of the next appropriate action. Simulations demonstrate how these mechanisms can guide performance in a range of goal-directed tasks, and provide a functional framework for some of the neuronal responses previously observed in the medial prefrontal cortex during performance of spatial memory tasks in rats.",NA,NA,NA,,"Hasselmo, Michael/0000-0002-9925-6377",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0898-929X,1530-8898,,NA,NA,JUL,2005,17,7,NA,,,,1115,1129,,10.1162/0898929054475190,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000230933400011,16102240,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The rich behavioral plasticity exhibited by songbirds, however, contrasts starkly with the scarcity of candidate cellular mechanisms. Here, we report for the first time on an activity-dependent form of synaptic plasticity in area X, a component of the song system required for song learning and song maintenance. In slice preparations of zebra finch area X, pairing of high-frequency presynaptic stimulation with postsynaptic depolarization induces Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) of the glutamatergic inputs to spiny neurons. This form of LTP requires activation of NMDA receptors and D1-like dopamine receptors. In addition, LTP is observed in birds as young as 47 d after hatching and also in adult birds but not in younger birds, providing evidence of developmental regulation of the onset of synaptic plasticity. These properties make this form of LTP the best known candidate mechanism for reinforcement-based vocal learning in juveniles and song maintenance in adult birds.",NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0270-6474,1529-2401,,NA,NA,Jan-14,2004,24,2,NA,,,,488,494,,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4358-03.2004,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000188098000020,14724247,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
