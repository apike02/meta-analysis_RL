Previous research suggests disclosure, lack of staff knowledge and poor communication between University and placement sites may be relevant, but these are limited to small case studies with students with visual or physical disabilities. The purpose of this study was to explore disabled physiotherapy students' experiences of their education in order to elucidate factors that may influence success. Methods Qualitative study drawing on phenomenological traditions. Four focus groups including 15 students with disabilities were conducted. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Procedures for transparency and rigour such as member checking and peer debriefing were implemented. Results Three major themes were derived from data. It was quite a relief explores the personal and social implications of diagnosis. They're not natural focuses on academic assessment and the specifics of adjustments made and not made within that context. My dyslexia doesn't switch off explores the inaccessibility of the learning environment and dissects the contrast between the 24-h nature of having a specific learning condition and the somewhat piecemeal nature of adjustments during their education. Conclusions This study indicates that having a specific learning disability or anxiety creates a number of hurdles to success in physiotherapy education. Most were within the University setting and were perceived to result from staff ignorance or piecemeal approaches to inclusion. A lack of consistency alongside facilitated dialogue and acknowledgement of enhancements results in frustration, ambiguity towards disclosure and reinforcement of a deficit model. Such an approach belies the intention of the profession and the NHS and does not maximise the potential of widening participation.",,,,,"Norris, Meriel/0000-0001-7779-5612; Williams, Annabel/0000-0002-3192-5490",,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-6920,,,,DEC 31,2020,20,1,,,,,,,2,10.1186/s12909-019-1913-3,,,,,,,WOS:000505043800002,31892332,,,,,

We analyzed reinforcement-based decision making in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) to identify the specific decision mechanisms contributing to poorer performance. Individuals with MDD (n = 64) and matched healthy controls (n = 64) performed a probabilistic reversal-learning task in which they used feedback to identify which of two stimuli had the highest probability of reward (reward condition) or lowest probability of punishment (punishment condition). Learning differences were characterized using a hierarchical Bayesian reinforcement learning model. Depressed individuals made fewer optimal choices and adjusted more slowly to reversals in both the reward and punishment conditions. Computational modeling revealed that depressed individuals showed lower learning-rates and, to a lesser extent, lower value sensitivity in both the reward and punishment conditions. Learning-rates also predicted depression more accurately than simple performance metrics. These results demonstrate that depression is characterized by a hyposensitivity to positive outcomes, but not a hypersensitivity to negative outcomes. Additionally, we demonstrate that computational modeling provides a more precise characterization of the dynamics contributing to these learning deficits, offering stronger insights into the mechanistic processes affected by depression.",,,,"; Satterthwaite, Theodore/N-4804-2017","Filipowicz, Alexandre/0000-0002-1311-386X; Satterthwaite, Theodore/0000-0001-7072-9399; MUKHERJEE, DAHLIA/0000-0003-1007-2094; Vo, Khoi/0000-0002-6000-2628",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-843X,1939-1846,,,,NOV,2020,129,8,,,,,810,823,,10.1037/abn0000641,,,,,,,WOS:000585873700004,33001663,,,,,

This study was designed to test whether lithium administration may stabilize mood via effects on reward processing. It was hypothesized that lithium administration would modulate reward processing in the striatum and affect both anticipation and outcome computations. Thirty-seven healthy human participants (18 males, 33 with suitable fMRI data) received 11 (+/- 1) days of lithium carbonate or placebo intervention (double-blind), after which they completed the monetary incentive delay task while fMRI data were collected. The monetary incentive delay task is a robust task with excellent test-retest reliability and is well suited to investigate different phases of reward processing within the caudate and nucleus accumbens. To test for correlations with prediction error signals a Rescorla-Wagner reinforcement-learning model was applied. Lithium administration enhanced activity in the caudate during reward anticipation compared to placebo. In contrast, lithium administration reduced caudate and nucleus accumbens activity during reward outcome. This latter effect seems related to learning as reward prediction errors showed a positive correlation with caudate and nucleus accumbens activity during placebo, which was absent after lithium administration. Lithium differentially modulates the anticipation relative to the learning of rewards. This suggests that lithium might reverse dampened reward anticipation while reducing overactive reward updating in patients with bipolar disorder. This specific effect of lithium suggests that a targeted modulation of reward learning may be a viable approach for novel interventions in bipolar disorder.",,,,,"Volman, Inge/0000-0003-3467-1841",,,,,,,,,,,,0893-133X,1740-634X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1038/s41386-020-00895-2,,OCT 2020,,,,,WOS:000582992200001,33127993,,,,,

Computational work suggests that these biases may stem from a belief that negative events have a higher information content than positive events, resulting in preferential processing of and learning from negative outcomes. Learning biases therefore represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions. In this proof-of-concept study in healthy volunteers, we assessed the malleability of biased reinforcement learning using a novel cognitive training paradigm and concurrent transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Methods In two studies, young healthy adults completed two sessions of negative (n = 20) or positive (n = 20) training designed to selectively increase learning from loss or win outcomes, respectively. During training active or sham tDCS was applied bilaterally to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Analyses tested for changes both in learning rates and win- and loss-driven behaviour. Potential positive/negative emotional transfer of win/loss learning was assessed by a facial emotion recognition task and mood questionnaires. Results Negative and positive training increased learning rates for losses and wins, respectively. With negative training, there was also a trend for win (but not loss) learning rates to decrease over successive task blocks. After negative training, there was evidence for near transfer in the form of an increase in loss-driven choices when participants performed a similar (untrained) task. There was no change in far transfer measures of emotional face processing or mood. tDCS had no effect on any aspect of behaviour. Discussion and Conclusions Negative training induced a mild negative bias in healthy adults as reflected in loss-driven choice behaviour. Prefrontal tDCS had no effect. Further research is needed to assess if this training procedure can be adapted to enhance learning from positive outcomes and whether effects translate to affective disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0147-5916,1573-2819,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10608-020-10146-9,,OCT 2020,,,,,WOS:000575339800001,,,,,,

The present study aims to identify common and disorder-specific neuropathological mechanisms and treatment targets in MDD and GAD. To this end we combined categorical and dimensional disorder models with a fully data-driven intrinsic network-level analysis (intrinsic connectivity contrast, ICC) to resting-state fMRI data acquired in 108 individuals (n = 35 andn = 38 unmedicated patients with first-episode GAD, MDD, respectively, andn = 35 healthy controls). Convergent evidence from categorical and dimensional analyses revealed MDD-specific decreased whole-brain connectivity profiles of the medial prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while GAD was specifically characterized by decreased whole-brain connectivity profiles of the putamen and decreased communication of this region with the amygdala. Together, findings from the present data-driven analysis suggest that intrinsic communication of frontal regions engaged in executive functions and emotion regulation represent depression-specific neurofunctional markers and treatment targets whereas dysregulated intrinsic communication of the striato-amygdala system engaged in reinforcement-based and emotional learning processes represent GAD-specific markers.",,,,"Zhou, Xinqi/R-3616-2019","Zhou, Xinqi/0000-0002-5032-9141",,,,,,,,,,,,0893-133X,1740-634X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1038/s41386-020-00868-5,,SEP 2020,,,,,WOS:000575748200001,32961541,,,,,

We found that it learns a simple spatial alternation task more slowly and makes different errors than a group of male rats, illustrating that memory alone may not be sufficient to capture the behavior.

Theory and Study Protocol for App-Based Anxiety Program,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Objective: Anxiety is associated with sleep disturbance and insomnia. Mindfulness-based interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, have shown consistent anxiety reduction. Mindfulness training has been theorized to affect reinforcement learning, affecting habitual behaviors such as smoking and overeating, but a direct mechanistic link between the use of mindfulness training for anxiety reduction and improvement in sleep has not been studied. Moreover, the mechanisms by which mindfulness might affect worry and subsequent sleep disturbances have not been elucidated. This study protocol evaluates the impact an app-based mindfulness training program for anxiety might have on decreasing worry and improvement in sleep. Method: A randomized controlled study will be conducted in approximately 80 adults with worry that interferes with their sleep. Participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to two groups: treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU + App-Based Mindfulness Training (Unwinding Anxiety app). The primary outcomes will be the non-reactivity subscale of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System sleep quality measures (Baer et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2011). Secondary outcomes will include the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Scale (Mehling et al., 2012; Meyer. Miller. Metzger, & Borkovec. 1990; Spitzer. Kroenke, Williams. & Lowe, 2006). Discussion: This study will be the first to test the mechanism of app-based mindfulness training on worry and sleep disturbance. Testing the mechanistic effects of mindfulness training using the science of behavior change framework will help move the field forward both in further elucidation of potential mechanisms of mindfulness (e.g., targeting reinforcement learning) and determining whether such a platform might be a viable method for delivering high-fidelity treatment at scale and for a low cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0278-6133,1930-7810,,,,SEP,2020,39,9,,,SI,,776,784,,10.1037/hea0000874,,,,,,,WOS:000563083500006,32833479,,,,,

Individuals differ remarkably in their tendency to acquire and perform new avoidance behaviors, as seen in anxiety disorders where avoidance becomes pervasive and inappropriate. In rodent models of avoidance, the inbred Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat demonstrates increased learning and expression of avoidance compared to the outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) rat. However, underlying mechanisms that contribute to these differences are unclear. Computational modeling techniques can help identify factors that may not be easily decipherable from behavioral data alone. Here, we utilize a reinforcement learning (RL) model approach to better understand strain differences in avoidance behavior. An actor-critic model, with separate learning rates for action selection (in the actor) and state evaluation (in the critic), was applied to individual data of avoidance acquisition from a large cohort of WKY and SD rats. Latent parameters were extracted, such as learning rate and subjective reinforcement value of foot shock, that were then compared across groups. The RL model was able to accurately represent WKY and SD avoidance behavior, demonstrating that the model could simulate individual performance. The model determined that the perceived negative value of foot shock was significantly higher in WKY than SD rats, whereas learning rate in the actor was lower in WKY than SD rats. These findings demonstrate the utility of computational modeling in identifying underlying processes that could promote strain differences in behavioral performance.",,,,,"Palmieri, John/0000-0001-8603-7848",,,,,,,,,,,,0166-4328,1872-7549,,,,SEP 1,2020,393,,,,,,,,112784,10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112784,,,,,,,WOS:000557870200034,32585299,,,,,

The Emotional Reversal Learning Task (ERLT) was designed to investigate this, and we examined its construct validity by inducing social rejection, an etiological process of depression, within the ERLT model. We expected excluded participants to have difficulty disengaging from NSP. Methods: We administered Cyberball to 130 participants randomly assigned to the excluded or included condition. Participants then completed the ERLT: They chose a valence option (positive or negative), retrieved a memory of the same valence, and then were rewarded or punished for their valence choice. For the first phase, retrieving a negative memory was probabilistically rewarded, and this action-outcome contingency was twice reversed during the task. We used Q-learning models to analyze learning rates. Results: Excluded participants had no more difficulty disengaging from NSP than included participants: Bayesian computational modeling identified no difference between conditions regarding learning that retrieving negative memories was punished. Exploratory analyses found that excluded participants learned the association between retrieving positive memories and reward quicker than included participants, however. Limitations: Doubts remain regarding whether participants fully understood action-outcome contingencies, and we did not explicitly check whether participants truly retrieved memories, which could have affected results.

Recent work has studied the effects of uncertainty on individuals expressing behavioral inhibition (BI). The current study extended this work with uncertainty to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats which are a behaviorally inhibited inbred strain that models learning vulnerabilities for anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). WKY rats exhibit superior avoidance performance in a signaled bar press avoidance task in which a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) signals a foot shock unconditional stimulus (US) when compared with non-inhibited Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. In addition, WKY rats express enhanced eyeblink conditioning. Recent work with behaviorally inhibited humans has indicated that this enhanced eyeblink conditioning is more evident in conditions that insert CS- or US-alone trials into CS-US paired training, resulting in uncertain and suboptimal learning conditions. The current study examined the effects of partial predictability training, in which the CS signaled the US only one-half of the time, on the acquisition and expression of avoidance. Standard training with a fixed 60-s CS which predicted shock on 100% of trials was compared with training in which the CS predicted shock on 50% of trials (partial predictability) using a pseudorandom schedule. As expected, WKY rats acquired avoidance responses faster and to a greater degree than SD rats. Partial predictability of the US essentially reduced SD rats to escape responding. Partial predictability also reduced avoidance in WKY rats; however, adjusting avoidance rates for the number of potential pairings of the CS and US early in training suggested a similar degree of avoidance expression late in the last session of training. Enhanced active avoidance expression, even in uncertain learning conditions, can be interpreted as behaviorally inhibited WKY rats responding to the expectancy of the shock by avoiding, whereas non-inhibited SD rats were responding to the presence of the shock by escaping. Future work should explore how WKY and SD rats as well as behaviorally inhibited humans acquire and extinguish avoidance responses in uncertain learning situations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-0640,,,,,AUG 19,2020,11,,,,,,,,848,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00848,,,,,,,WOS:000566189900001,32973587,,,,,

In comparison to a safe control condition, the threat of shock significantly impaired reward reversal learning. Moreover, enhanced self-reported threat ratings and elevated skin conductance levels support the successful induction of stressful and aversive apprehensions. The findings are in line with literature showing the stress-induced inhibition of goal-directed behavior at the advantage of a reflexive (habitual) response style. Notably, reversal learning was rapidly restored with the omission of threat through several cycles of threat and safety contexts within one experimental session.

The current study aimed to test the effect of therapeutic doses ofd-amphetamine on effort for reward and reward learning in the same healthy volunteers.

Secondarily, we examined whether the individual characteristics of baseline working memory and willingness to exert effort for reward moderated the effects ofd-amphetamine.d-Amphetamine increased willingness to exert effort, particularly at low to intermediate expected values of reward. Computational modeling analyses suggested this was due to decreased effort discounting rather than probability discounting or decision consistency. Both baseline effort and working memory emerged as moderators of this effect, such that d-amphetamine increased effort more in individuals with lower working memory and lower baseline effort, also primarily at low to intermediate expected values of reward.

Accumulating evidence points to the role of the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) and Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) in these processes, but their differential contributions have not been convincingly deciphered in humans. We detect 310 neurons from mPFC and MTL from patients with epilepsy undergoing intracranial recordings and participating in a goal-conflict task where rewards and punishments could be controlled or not. mPFC neurons are more selective to punishments than rewards when controlled. However, only MTL firing following punishment is linked to a lower probability for subsequent approach behavior. mPFC response to punishment precedes a similar MTL response and affects subsequent behavior via an interaction with MTL firing. We thus propose a model where approach-avoidance conflict resolution in humans depends on outcome value tagging in mPFC neurons influencing encoding of such value in MTL to affect subsequent choice.",,,,"Gurevitch, Guy/ABB-4725-2020","Gurevitch, Guy/0000-0001-9245-6838; Fahoum, Firas/0000-0003-2262-5530",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,,,JUN 24,2020,11,1,,,,,,,3192,10.1038/s41467-020-16908-z,,,,,,,WOS:000548926500008,32581214,,,,,

Among the many emotion recognition methods, electroencephalogram (EEG) shows advantage in reliability and accuracy. However, the individual differences of EEG limit the generalization of emotion classifiers across subjects. Moreover, due to the nonstationary characteristic of EEG, the signals of one subject change over time, which is a challenge to acquire models that could work across sessions. In this article, we propose a novel domain adaptation method to generalize the emotion recognition models across subjects and sessions. We use neural networks to implement the emotion recognition models, which are optimized by minimizing the classification error on the source while making the source and the target similar in their latent representations. Considering the functional differences of the network layers, we use adversarial training to adapt the marginal distributions in the early layers and perform association reinforcement to adapt the conditional distributions in the last layers. In this way, we approximately adapt the joint distributions by simultaneously adapting marginal distributions and conditional distributions. The method is compared with multiple representatives and recent domain adaptation algorithms on benchmark SEED and DEAP for recognizing three and four affective states, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method reaches and outperforms the state of the arts.",,,,,"/0000-0001-8701-2642; He, Huiguang/0000-0002-0684-1711",,,,,,,,,,,,2379-8920,2379-8939,,,,JUN,2020,12,2,,,,,344,353,,10.1109/TCDS.2019.2949306,,,,,,,WOS:000542972700021,,,,,,

Douglas",,,Blunted medial prefrontal cortico-limbic reward-related effective connectivity and depression,BRAIN,,,,,,,,,,,,"Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability and significant mortality, yet mechanistic understanding remains limited. Over the past decade evidence has accumulated from case-control studies that depressive illness is associated with blunted reward activation in the basal ganglia and other regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex. However it is unclear whether this finding can be replicated in a large number of subjects. The functional anatomy of the medial prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia has been extensively studied and the former has excitatory glutamatergic projections to the latter. Reduced effect of glutamatergic projections from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens has been argued to underlie motivational disorders such as depression, and many prominent theories of major depressive disorder propose a role for abnormal cortico-limbic connectivity. However, it is unclear whether there is abnormal reward-linked effective connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia related to depression. While resting state connectivity abnormalities have been frequently reported in depression, it has not been possible to directly link these findings to reward-learning studies. Here, we tested two main hypotheses. First, mood symptoms are associated with blunted striatal reward prediction error signals in a large community-based sample of recovered and currently ill patients, similar to reports from a number of studies. Second, event-related directed medial prefrontal cortex to basal ganglia effective connectivity is abnormally increased or decreased related to the severity of mood symptoms. Using a Research Domain Criteria approach, data were acquired from a large community-based sample of subjects who participated in a probabilistic reward learning task during event-related functional MRI. Computational modelling of behaviour, model-free and model-based functional MRI, and effective connectivity dynamic causal modelling analyses were used to test hypotheses. Increased depressive symptom severity was related to decreased reward signals in areas which included the nucleus accumbens in 475 participants. Decreased rewardrelated effective connectivity from the medial prefrontal cortex to striatum was associated with increased depressive symptom severity in 165 participants. Decreased striatal activity may have been due to decreased cortical to striatal connectivity consistent with glutamatergic and cortical-limbic related theories of depression and resulted in reduced direct pathway basal ganglia output. Further study of basal ganglia pathophysiology is required to better understand these abnormalities in patients with depressive symptoms and syndromes.",,,,"Shen, Xueyi/AAS-8960-2020","Shen, Xueyi/0000-0002-0538-4774; Rupprechter, Samuel/0000-0002-8708-1928; Lawrie, Stephen/0000-0002-2444-5675; Steele, J Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Waiter, Gordon/0000-0002-5313-9845; Sandu, Anca-Larisa/0000-0002-5555-4129; Murray, Alison/0000-0003-4915-4847",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8950,1460-2156,,,,JUN,2020,143,,6,,,,1946,1956,,10.1093/brain/awaa106,,,,,,,WOS:000541788700035,32385498,,,,,

However, no studies have particularly targeted aversive prediction errors, despite the essential importance for the habenula in the field. Complicated learned strategies including contextual contents are involved in making aversive prediction errors during the learning process. Therefore, we examined habenula activation during a contextual learning task. We performed fMRI on a group of 19 healthy controls. We assessed the manually traced habenula during negative outcomes during the contextual learning task. The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were also administered. The left and right habenula were activated during aversive outcomes and the activation was associated with aversive prediction errors. There was also a positive correlation between TCI reward dependence scores and habenula activation. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses demonstrated the left and right habenula to the left and right hippocampus connections during the presentation of contextual stimuli. These findings serve to highlight the neural mechanisms that may be relevant to understanding the broader relationship between the habenula and learning processes.",,,,"Nakano, Takashi/B-6061-2015","Nakano, Takashi/0000-0003-0707-4486; Aizawa, Hidenori/0000-0002-2896-1298",,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5161,,,,,MAY 12,2020,14,,,,,,,,165,10.3389/fnhum.2020.00165,,,,,,,WOS:000537213000001,32477084,,,,,

It is unclear whether this behaviour can be linked to changes in cortico-striatal plasticity demonstrated in animal models which share the same TOR1A mutation. We hypothesised that we could reproduce the experimental risk taking behaviour using a model of the basal ganglia under conditions where cortico-striatal plasticity was abnormal. As dopamine exerts opposing effects on cortico-striatal plasticity via different receptors expressed on medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the direct (D1R dominant, dMSNs) and indirect (D2R dominant, iMSNs) pathways, we tested whether abnormalities in cortico-striatal plasticity in one or both of these pathways could explain the patient's behaviour. Our model could generate simulated behaviour indistinguishable from patients when cortico-striatal plasticity was abnormal in both dMSNs and iMSNs in opposite directions. The risk neutral behaviour of the patients was replicated when increased cortico-striatal long term potentiation in dMSN's was in combination with increased long term depression in iMSN's. This result is consistent with previous observations in rodent models of increased cortico-striatal plasticity at in dMSNs, but contrasts with the pattern reported in vitro of dopamine D2 receptor dependant increases in cortico-striatal LTP and loss of LTD at iMSNs. These results suggest that additional factors in patients who manifest motor symptoms may lead to divergent effects on D2 receptor dependant cortico-striatal plasticity that are not apparent in rodent models of this disease.",,,,,"Steele, J Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Gilbertson, Tom/0000-0002-9866-1565",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAY 4,2020,15,5,,,,,,,e0226790,10.1371/journal.pone.0226790,,,,,,,WOS:000536959700004,32365120,,,,,

Whilst research on mechanism and causation has predominated, the study of function is less advanced. This is not due to a lack of hypotheses; in both humans and animals, affective states are frequently proposed to play a pivotal role in coordinating adaptive responses and decisions. However, exactly how they might do this (what processes might implement this function) is often left rather vague. Here we propose a framework for integrating animal affect and decision-making that is couched in modern decision theory and employs an operational definition that aligns with dimensional concepts of core affect and renders animal affect empirically tractable. We develop a model of how core affect, including short-term (emotion-like) and longer-term (mood-like) states, influence decision-making via processes that we label affective options, affective predictions, and affective outcomes and which correspond to similar concepts in schema of the links between human emotion and decision-making.

Using a dynamic trust game and a matched nonsocial task, we found that healthy subjects (n = 257) were particularly good at learning under negative social uncertainty, swiftly figuring out when to stop investing in an exploitative social partner. In contrast, subjects with anxiety (n = 97) overinvested in exploitative partners.

There is a growing desire to understand the mechanisms by which such therapies effect change so as to improve treatment outcomes. Here we argue that adopting a computational framework may be one such approach. Computational psychiatry aims to provide a theoretical framework for moving between higher-level psychological states (like emotions, decisions and beliefs) to neural circuits, by modeling these constructs mathematically. These models are explicit hypotheses that contain quantifiable variables and parameters derived from each individual's behavior. This approach has two advantages. Firstly, some of the variables described by these models appears to reflect the neural activity of specific brain regions. Secondly, the parameters estimated by these models may offer a unique description of a patient's symptoms which can be used to both tailor therapy and track its effect. In doing so this approach may offer some additional granularity in understanding how psychological therapies, such as CBT, are working.

We compare participants diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n = 64) to healthy controls (n = 64) using a comprehensive battery of nine value-based decision-making tasks which yield ten distinct measures. MDD participants performed worse on punishment (d = -0.54) and reward learning tasks (d = 0.38), expressed more pessimistic predictions regarding winning money in the study (d = -0.47) and were less willing to wait in a persistence task (d = -0.39). Performance on learning, expectation, and persistence tasks each loaded on unique dimensions in a factor analysis and punishment learning and future expectations each accounted for unique variance in predicting depressed status. Decision-making performance alone could predict depressed status out-of-sample with 72% accuracy. The findings are limited to MDD patients ranging between moderate to severe depression and the effects of medication could not be accounted for due to the cross sectional nature of the study design.

Computational models of ARDM have been implemented primarily as state-dependent reinforcement learning models with bias parameters to quantify Pavlovian associations, and differential learning rates to quantify instrumental updating have been shown to depend on context, involve complex cost calculations, and include the consideration of counterfactual outcomes. Little is known about how individual differences influence these models relevant to anxiety-related conditions or addiction-related dysfunction. It is argued that model parameters reflecting 1) Pavlovian biases in the context of reinforcement learning or 2) hyperprecise prior beliefs in the context of active inference play an important role in the emergence of dysfunctional avoidance behaviors. The neural implementation of ARDM includes brain areas that are important for valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and positive reinforcement-related prediction errors (ventral striatum), but also aversive processing (insular cortex and cerebellum). Computational models of ARDM will help to establish a quantitative explanatory account of the development of anxiety disorders and addiction, but such models also face several challenges, including limited evidence for stability of individual differences, relatively low reliability of tasks, and disorder heterogeneity.

However, they also engage the brain systems for stress and pain (somatic and emotional) while producing hyperalgesia and hyperkatifeia, which drive pronounced drug-seeking behavior via processes of negative reinforcement. Hyperkatifeia (derived from the Greek katifeia for dejection or negative emotional state) is defined as an increase in intensity of the constellation of negative emotional or motivational signs and symptoms of withdrawal from drugs of abuse. In animal models, repeated extended access to drugs or opioids results in negative emotion-like states, reflected by the elevation of reward thresholds, lower pain thresholds, anxiety-like behavior, and dysphoric-like responses. Such negative emotional states that drive negative reinforcement are hypothesized to derive from the within-system dysregulation of key neurochemical circuits that mediate incentive-salience and/or reward systems (dopamine, opioid peptides) in the ventral striatum and from the between-system recruitment of brain stress systems (corticotropin-releasing factor, dynorphin, norepinephrine, hypocretin, vasopressin, glucocorticoids, and neuroimmune factors) in the extended amygdala. Hyperkatifeia can extend into protracted abstinence and interact with learning processes in the form of conditioned withdrawal to facilitate relapse to compulsive-like drug seeking. Compelling evidence indicates that plasticity in the brain pain emotional systems is triggered by acute excessive drug intake and becomes sensitized during the development of compulsive drug taking with repeated withdrawal.

However, the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects of self-administered drugs on behavioral flexibility are not well understood. To investigate whether drug exposure causes asymmetric effects on positive and negative outcomes we used a reversal learning procedure to assess how reward contingencies are utilized to guide behavior in rats previously exposed to intravenous cocaine self-administration (SA). Twenty-four rats were screened for anxiety in an open field prior to acquisition of cocaine SA over six daily sessions with subsequent long-access cocaine SA for 7 days. Control rats (n = 24) were trained to lever-press for food under a yoked schedule of reinforcement. Higher rates of cocaine SA were predicted by increased anxiety and preceded impaired reversal learning, expressed by a decrease in lose-shift as opposed to win-stay probability. A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm revealed that rats with high, but not low cocaine escalation failed to exploit previous reward learning and were more likely to repeat the same response as the previous trial. Eight-day withdrawal from high cocaine escalation was associated, respectively, with increased and decreased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) expression in the ventral striatum compared with controls. Dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) expression was also significantly reduced in the orbitofrontal cortex of high cocaine-escalating rats. These findings indicate that withdrawal from escalated cocaine SA disrupts how negative feedback is used to guide goal-directed behavior for natural reinforcers and that trait anxiety may be a latent variable underlying this interaction.",,,,,"Puaud, Mickael/0000-0002-7943-1801; Sala-Bayo, Julia/0000-0003-4574-5201; Sabir, Aryan/0000-0002-9710-8864; Jupp, Bianca/0000-0002-9163-9170",,,,,,,,,,,,0893-133X,1740-634X,,,,DEC,2019,44,13,,,,,2163,2173,,10.1038/s41386-019-0381-0,,,,,,,WOS:000496913900007,30952156,,,,,

AbstractThe emerging research field of so-called computational psychiatry attempts to contribute to an understanding of complex psychiatric phenomena by applying computational methods and to promote the translation of neuroscientific research results into clinical practice. This article presents this field of research using selected examples based on the distinction between data-driven and theory-driven approaches. Exemplary for a data-driven approach are studies to predict clinical outcome, for example, in persons with a high-risk state for psychosis or on the response to pharmacological treatment for depression. Theory-driven approaches attempt to describe the mechanisms of altered information processing as the cause of psychiatric symptoms at the behavioral and neuronal level. In computational models possible mechanisms can be described that may have produced the measured behavioral or neuronal data. For example, in schizophrenia patients the clinical phenomenon of aberrant salience has been described as learning irrelevant information or cognitive deficits have been linked to connectivity changes in frontoparietal networks. Computational psychiatry can make important contributions to the prediction of individual clinical courses as well as to a mechanistic understanding of psychiatric symptoms. For this a further development of reliable and valid methods across different disciplines is indispensable.",,,,,"Katthagen, Teresa/0000-0002-7537-4192; Schlagenhauf, Florian/0000-0001-8340-5027; Kaminski, Jakob/0000-0001-8155-3683",,,,,,,,,,,,0028-2804,1433-0407,,,,NOV,2019,90,11,,,SI,,1117,1124,,10.1007/s00115-019-00796-w,,,,,,,WOS:000494890600006,31538209,,,,,

The brain expresses nine membrane-bound AC variants, and AC5 is the dominant form in the striatum. The striatum is the input stage of the basal ganglia, a brain structure involved in reward learning, i.e. the learning of behaviors that lead to rewarding stimuli (such as food, water, sugar, etc). During reward learning, cAMP production is crucial for strengthening the synapses from cortical neurons onto the striatal principal neurons, and its formation is dependent on several neuromodulatory systems such as dopamine and acetylcholine. It is, however, not understood how AC5 is activated by transient (subsecond) changes in the neuromodulatory signals. Here we combine several computational tools, from molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations to bioinformatics approaches, to inform and constrain a kinetic model of the AC5-dependent signaling system. We use this model to show how the specific molecular properties of AC5 can detect particular combinations of co-occuring transient changes in the neuromodulatory signals which thus result in a supralinear/synergistic cAMP production. Our results also provide insights into the computational capabilities of the different AC isoforms. Long-term potentiation and depression of synaptic activity in response to stimuli is a key factor in reinforcement learning. Strengthening of the corticostriatal synapses depends on the second messenger cAMP, whose synthesis is catalysed by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase 5 (AC5), which is itself regulated by the stimulatory G alpha(olf) and inhibitory G alpha(i) proteins. AC isoforms have been suggested to act as coincidence detectors, promoting cellular responses only when convergent regulatory signals occur close in time. However, the mechanism for this is currently unclear, and seems to lie in their diverse regulation patterns. Despite attempts to isolate the ternary complex, it is not known if G alpha(olf) and G alpha(i) can bind to AC5 simultaneously, nor what activity the complex would have. Using protein structure-based molecular dynamics simulations, we show that this complex is stable and inactive. These simulations, along with Brownian dynamics simulations to estimate protein association rates constants, constrain a kinetic model that shows that the presence of this ternary inactive complex is crucial for AC5's ability to detect coincident signals, producing a synergistic increase in cAMP. These results reveal some of the prerequisites for corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, and explain recent experimental data on cAMP concentrations following receptor activation. Moreover, they provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control signal processing by different AC isoforms.",,,,"Bruce, Neil J/E-8455-2012","Bruce, Neil J/0000-0002-2735-3215; Nair, Anu/0000-0002-1952-9583; Hellgren Kotaleski, Jeanette/0000-0002-0550-0739; Narzi, Daniele/0000-0003-2731-6286; Carloni, Paolo/0000-0002-9010-0149; Wade, Rebecca/0000-0001-5951-8670",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,OCT,2019,15,10,,,,,,,e1007382,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007382,,,,,,,WOS:000500776600040,31665146,,,,,

It is unclear whether similar abnormalities contribute to the pathophysiology of cervical dystonia, the most common type of focal dystonia. We investigated whether abnormal cortico-striatal synaptic plasticity contributes to abnormal reward-learning behavior in patients with focal dystonia. Forty patients and 40 controls performed a reward gain and loss avoidance reversal learning task. Participant's behavior was fitted to a computational model of the basal ganglia incorporating detailed cortico-striatal synaptic learning rules. Model comparisons were performed to assess the ability of four hypothesized receptor specific abnormalities of cortico-striatal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD): increased or decreased D1:LTP/LTD and increased or decreased D2: LTP/LTD to explain abnormal behavior in patients. Patients were selectively impaired in the post-reversal phase of the reward task. Individual learning rates in the reward reversal task correlated with the severity of the patient's motor symptoms. A model of the striatum with decreased D2:LTP/ LTD best explained the patient's behavior, suggesting excessive D2 cortico-striatal synaptic depotentiation could underpin biased reward-learning in patients with cervical dystonia. Reversal learning impairment in cervical dystonia may be a behavioral correlate of D2-specific abnormalities in cortico-striatal synaptic plasticity.

We predicted that anxious individuals under stress would learn faster about punishments and exhibit choices that were more affected by those punishments, thus formalizing our predictions as parameters in reinforcement learning accounts of behaviour.

A proposed mechanism of exposure involves inhibitory learning whereby the association between a stimulus and an aversive outcome is suppressed by a new association with an appetitive or neutral outcome. The blood pressure medication losartan augments fear extinction in rodents and may have similar synergistic effects on human exposure therapy, but the exact cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. METHODS: We used a reinforcement learning paradigm with compound rewards and punishments to test the prediction that losartan augments learning from appetitive relative to aversive outcomes. In a double-blind parallel design, healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to single-dose losartan (50 mg) (n = 28) versus placebo (n = 25). Participants then performed a reinforcement learning task, which simultaneously probes appetitive and aversive learning. Participant choice behavior was analyzed using both a standard reinforcement learning model and analysis of choice switching behavior. RESULTS: Losartan significantly reduced learning rates from aversive events (losses) when participants were first exposed to the novel task environment, while preserving learning from positive outcomes. The same effect was seen in choice switching behavior. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that losartan enhances learning from positive relative to negative events.

However, in reality, rumination often leads to unfavorable outcomes. Thus, such beliefs create a large discrepancy between one's expectations and the actual outcome. Therefore, we hypothesized that this prediction error would be associated with increased depressed mood. Methods: We observed how people update their positive beliefs about negative cognition within a volatile environment, in which negative cognition does not always result in a beneficial outcome. Forty-six participants were offered two response options (retrieving a negative or positive personal memory) and subsequently provided either an economic reward or punishment. Retrieving a negative (rather than positive) memory was initially reinforced, although this action-outcome contingency was reversed during the task. In the control condition, positive memory retrieval was initially reinforced, although a contingency reversal was employed to encourage negative memory retrieval. Results: Model-based computational modeling revealed that participants who showed a delay in switching from negative to positive (but not from positive to negative) responses experienced increased levels of depressed mood. This delay in switching was also found to be associated with depressive symptoms and trait rumination.

In patients with major depressive disorder, a dysfunctional reward-system may exist, with blunted temporal difference reward-related learning signals in the ventral striatum and increased temporal difference-related (dopaminergic) activation in the ventral tegmental area. Anhedonia often remains as residual symptom during remission; however, it remains largely unknown whether the abovementioned reward systems are still dysfunctional when patients are in remission. We used a Pavlovian classical conditioning functional MRI task to explore the relationship between anhedonia and the temporal difference-related response of the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum in medication-free remitted recurrent depression patients (n = 36) versus healthy control subjects (n = 27). Computational modelling was used to obtain the expected temporal difference errors during this task. Patients, compared to healthy controls, showed significantly increased temporal difference reward learning activation in the ventral tegmental area (P-FWE,P- SVC = 0.028). No differences were observed between groups for ventral striatum activity. A group x anhedonia interaction [t(57) = -2.29, P = 0.026] indicated that in patients, higher anhedonia was associated with lower temporal difference activation in the ventral tegmental area, while in healthy controls higher anhedonia was associated with higher ventral tegmental area activation. These findings suggest impaired reward-related learning signals in the ventral tegmental area during remission in patients with depression. This merits further investigation to identify impaired reward-related learning as an endophenotype for recurrent depression. Moreover, the inverse association between reinforcement learning and anhedonia in patients implies an additional disturbing influence of anhedonia on reward-related learning or vice versa, suggesting that the level of anhedonia should be considered in behavioural treatments.",,,,"; Mocking, Roel/H-8131-2012","Steele, J Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Mocking, Roel/0000-0003-3543-3810; Servaas, Michelle/0000-0002-9222-7397",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8950,1460-2156,,,,AUG,2019,142,,8,,,,2510,2522,,10.1093/brain/awz167,,,,,,,WOS:000493084400036,31280309,,,,,

Although clinical evidence for the coexistence of depression and altered sensitivity to performance feedback is relatively coherent, we still do not know whether increased or decreased sensitivity to positive or negative feedback is associated with 'pro-depressive' profile in healthy subjects. Objective Our research has been designed to answer this question, and here, we present the first steps in that direction. Methods Using a rat version of the probabilistic reversal-learning (PRL) paradigm, we evaluated how sensitivity to negative and positive feedback influences other cognitive processes associated with mood disorders, such as motivation in the progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement (PRSR) paradigm, hedonic status in the sucrose preference (SP) test, locomotor and exploratory activity in the open field (OF) test, and anxiety in the light/dark box (LDB) test. Results The results of our study demonstrated for the first time that in rodents, sensitivity to negative and positive feedback could be considered a stable and enduring behavioural trait. Importantly, we also showed that these traits are independent of each other and that trait sensitivity to positive feedback is associated with cognitive flexibility in the PRL test. The computational modelling results also revealed that in animals classified as sensitive to positive feedback, the alpha learning rates for both positive and negative reward prediction errors were higher than those in animals classified as insensitive. We observed no statistically significant interactions between sensitivity to negative or positive feedback and the parameters measured in the PRSR, SP, OF or LDB tests. Conclusions Further studies using animal models of depression based on chronic stress should reveal whether sensitivity to feedback is a latent trait that when interacts with stressful life events, could produce correlates of depressive symptoms in rats.",,,,"Rygula, Rafal/AAI-4914-2020","Rygula, Rafal/0000-0002-3662-5833",,,,,,,,,,,,0033-3158,1432-2072,,,,AUG,2019,236,8,,,SI,,2389,2403,,10.1007/s00213-019-05333-w,,,,,,,WOS:000481767900008,31375849,,,,,

To date, much of the published work has focused on choice behaviors, which are primarily modeled within a reinforcement learning framework. While this initial normative effort represents a milestone in psychiatry research, the reality is that many psychiatric disorders are defined by disturbances in subjective states (e.g., depression, anxiety) and associated beliefs (e.g., dysmorphophobia, paranoid ideation), which are not considered in normative models. In this paper, we present interoceptive inference as a candidate framework for modeling subjective-and associated belief-states in computational psychiatry. We first introduce the notion and significance of modeling subjective states in computational psychiatry. Next, we present the interoceptive inference framework, and in particular focus on the relationship between interoceptive inference (i.e., belief updating) and emotions. Lastly, we will use drug craving as an example of subjective states to demonstrate the feasibility of using interoceptive inference to model the psychopathology of subjective states.",,,,"; Friston, Karl/D-9230-2011","Gu, Xiaosi/0000-0002-9373-987X; Friston, Karl/0000-0001-7984-8909",,,,,,,,,,,,0033-3158,1432-2072,,,,AUG,2019,236,8,,,SI,,2405,2412,,10.1007/s00213-019-05300-5,,,,,,,WOS:000481767900009,31230144,,,,,

This includes valence-dependent influences on action selection, e.g., increased avoidance but decreased approach behavior. However, it is yet unclear how aversive stimuli interact with complex learning and decision-making in the reward and avoidance domain. Moreover, the underlying computational mechanisms of these decision-making biases are unknown. Methods To elucidate these mechanisms, 54 healthy young male subjects performed a two-step sequential decision-making task, which allows to computationally model different aspects of learning, e.g., model-free, habitual, and model-based, goal-directed learning. We used a within-subject design, crossing task valence (reward vs. punishment learning) with emotional context (aversive vs. neutral background stimuli). We analyzed choice data, applied a computational model, and performed simulations. Results Whereas model-based learning was not affected, aversive stimuli interacted with model-free learning in a way that depended on task valence. Thus, aversive stimuli increased model-free avoidance learning but decreased model-free reward learning. The computational model confirmed this effect: the parameter lambda that indicates the influence of reward prediction errors on decision values was increased in the punishment condition but decreased in the reward condition when aversive stimuli were present. Further, by using the inferred computational parameters to simulate choice data, our effects were captured. Exploratory analyses revealed that the observed biases were associated with subclinical depressive symptoms. Conclusion Our data show that aversive environmental stimuli affect complex learning and decision-making, which depends on task valence. Further, we provide a model of the underlying computations of this affective modulation. Finally, our finding of increased decision-making biases in subjects reporting subclinical depressive symptoms matches recent reports of amplified Pavlovian influences on action selection in depression and suggests a potential vulnerability factor for mood disorders.

Consequently, pharmacological interventions aim to increase serotonin concentration in its target areas or stimulating excitatory 5HT receptors. A standard approach is to use serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which cause a higher accumulation of serotonin. Another approach is to stimulate excitatory serotonin receptors with psychedelic drugs. This article compares these two approaches by first setting up a system-level limbic system model of the relevant brain areas and then modelling a delayed reward paradigm which is known to be disrupted by a lack of 5HT. Central to our model is how serotonin changes the response characteristics of decision-making neurons where low levels of 5HT allow small signals to pass through, whereas high levels of 5HT create a barrier for smaller signals but amplifying the larger ones. We show with both standard behavioural simulations and model checking that SSRIs perform significantly better against interventions with psychedelics.

Here we suggest an alternative method using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to generate a flexible family of models that have sufficient capacity to represent the complex learning and decision- making strategies used by humans. In this approach, an RNN is trained to predict the next action that a subject will take in a decision-making task and, in this way, learns to imitate the processes underlying subjects' choices and their learning abilities. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach using a new dataset drawn from patients with either unipolar (n = 34) or bipolar (n = 33) depression and matched healthy controls (n = 34) making decisions on a two-armed bandit task. The results indicate that this new approach is better than baseline reinforcement-learning methods in terms of overall performance and its capacity to predict subjects' choices. We show that the model can be interpreted using off-policy simulations and thereby provides a novel clustering of subjects' learning processes-something that often eludes traditional approaches to modelling and behavioural analysis. Author summary Computational models of decision-making provide a quantitative characterisation of the learning and choice processes behind human actions. Designing a computational model is often based on manual engineering with an iterative process to examine the consistency between different aspects of the model and the empirical data. In practice, however, inconsistencies between the model and observed behaviours can remain hidden behind examined summary statistics. To address this limitation, we developed a recurrent neural network (RNNs) as a flexible type of model that can automatically characterize human decision-making processes without requiring tweaking and engineering. To show the benefits of this new approach, we collected data on a decision-making task conducted on subjects with either bipolar or unipolar depression, as well as healthy controls. The results showed that, indeed, important aspects of decision-making remained uncaptured by typical computational models and even their enhanced variants, but were captured by RNNs automatically. Further, we were able to show that the nature of such processes can be unveiled by simulating the model under various conditions. This new approach can be used, therefore, as a standalone model of decision-making or as a baseline model to evaluate how well other candidate models fit observed data.",,,,,"Dezfouli, Amir/0000-0002-7633-9225; Balleine, Bernard/0000-0001-8618-7950; Dayan, Peter/0000-0003-3476-1839",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,JUN,2019,15,6,,,,,,,e1006903,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006903,,,,,,,WOS:000474703000007,31185008,,,,,

While this approach has seen considerable success, a complementary approach allowing objective assessment of EI-relevant traits would provide some potential advantages. Among others, one potential advantage is that it would aid in emerging efforts to assess the brain basis of trait EI, where self-reported competency levels do not always match real-world behavior. In this paper, we review recent experimental paradigms in computational cognitive neuroscience (CCN), which allow behavioral estimates of individual differences in range of parameter values within computational models of neurocognitive processes. Based on this review, we illustrate how several of these parameters appear to correspond well to EI-relevant traits (i.e., differences in mood stability, stress vulnerability, self-control, and flexibility, among others). In contrast, although estimated objectively, these parameters do not correspond well to the optimal performance abilities assessed within competing ability models of EI. We suggest that adapting this approach from CCN-by treating parameter value estimates as objective trait EI measures-could (1) provide novel research directions, (2) aid in characterizing the neural basis of trait EI, and (3) offer a promising complementary assessment method.",,,,,"Smith, Ryan/0000-0002-4448-185X",,,,,,,,,,,,1664-1078,,,,,APR 18,2019,10,,,,,,,,848,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00848,,,,,,,WOS:000465124000001,31057467,,,,,

Neurocircuitry models posit that increased risk is mediated by heightened emotion processing in a salience network including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and amygdala. However, the processes of reinforcement learning (RL) also engage the salience network and are implicated in responses to early-life trauma and PTSD. To define their relative roles in response to early-life trauma and PTSD symptoms, the current study compared engagement of the salience network during emotion processing and RL as a function of early-life assault exposure. METHODS: Adolescent girls (n = 30 girls who had previously been physically or sexually assaulted; n = 30 healthy girls for comparison) 11 to 17 years of age completed two types of tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging: a facial emotion processing task and an RL task using either social or nonsocial stimuli. Independent component analysis was used to identify a salience network and characterize its engagement in response to emotion processing and prediction error encoding during the RL tasks. RESULTS: Assault was related to greater reactivity of the salience network during emotion processing. By contrast, we found lesser encoding of negative prediction errors in the salience network, particularly during the social RL task, in girls who had been assaulted. The dysfunction of salience network activity during emotion processing and prediction error encoding was not associated with PTSD symptoms.

There must be some pre-existing conditions that impart increased vulnerability to some individuals and not others. Diathesis models of PTSD theorize that pre-existing vulnerabilities interact with traumatic experiences to produce psychopathology. Recent work has indicated that personality factors such as behavioral inhibition (BI), harm avoidance (HA), and distressed (Type D) personality are vulnerability factors for the development of PTSD and anxiety disorders. These personality temperaments produce enhanced acquisition or maintenance of associations, especially avoidance, which is a criterion symptom of PTSD. In this review, we highlight the evidence for a relationship between these personality types and enhanced avoidance and associative learning, which may increase risk for the development of PTSD. First, we provide the evidence confirming a relationship among BI, HA, distressed (Type D) personality, and PTSD. Second, we present recent findings that BI is associated with enhanced avoidance learning in both humans and animal models. Third, we will review evidence that BI is also associated with enhanced eyeblink conditioning in both humans and animal models. Overall, data from both humans and animals suggest that these personality traits promote enhanced avoidance and associative learning, as well as slowing of extinction in some training protocols, which all support the learning diathesis model. These findings of enhanced learning in vulnerable individuals can be used to develop objective behavioral measures to pre-identify individuals who are more at risk for development of PTSD following traumatic events, allowing for early (possibly preventative) intervention, as well as suggesting possible therapies for PTSD targeted on remediating avoidance or associative learning.

Existing studies, however, do not definitively address whether suidice attempers have 1) impairment in learning from experience or 2) impairment in choice based on comparison of estimated option values. Our reinforcement learning model- based behavioral study tested these hypotheses directly in middle-aged and older suicide attempters representative of those who die by suicide. METHODS: Two samples (sample 1, n = 135; sample 2, n = 125) of suicide attempters with depression (n(attempters) = 54 and 39, respectively), suicide ideators, nonsuicidal patients with depression, and healthy control participants completed a probabilistic three-choice decision-making task. A second experiment in sample 2 experimentally dissociated long-term learned value from reward magnitude. Analyses combined computational reinforcement learning and mixed-effects models of decision times and choices. RESULTS: With regard to learning, suicide attempters (vs. all comparison groups) were less sensitive to one-back reinforcement, as indicated by a reduced effect on both choices and decision times. Learning deficits scaled with attempt lethality and were partially explained by poor cognitive control. With regard to value-based choice, suicide attempters (vs. all comparison groups) displayed abnormally long decision times when choosing between similarly valued options and were less able to distinguish between the best and second-best options. Group differences in value-based choice were robust to controlling for cognitive performance, comorbidities, impulsivity, psychotropic exposure, and possible brain damage from attempts.

The mechanisms that underlie probability-magnitude integration deficits, however, are poorly understood. We hypothesized that increased reliance on valueless stimulus-response associations, in lieu of expected value (EV)-based learning, could drive probability-magnitude integration deficits in PSZ with motivational deficits. METHODS: Healthy volunteers (n = 38) and PSZ (n = 49) completed a learning paradigm consisting of four stimulus pairs. Reward magnitude (3, 2, 1, 0 points) and probability (90%, 80%, 20%, 10%) determined each stimulus's EV. Following a learning phase, new and familiar stimulus pairings were presented. Participants were asked to select stimuli with the highest reward value. RESULTS: PSZ with high motivational deficits made increasingly less optimal choices as the difference in reward value (probability X magnitude) between two competing stimuli increased. Using a previously validated computational hybrid model, PSZ relied less on EV (Q-learning) and more on stimulus-response learning (actor-critic), which correlated with Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms motivational deficit severity. PSZ specifically failed to represent reward magnitude, consistent with model demonstrations showing that response tendencies in the actor-critic were preferentially driven by reward probability. CONCLUSIONS: Probability-magnitude deficits in PSZ with motivational deficits arise from underutilization of EV in favor of reliance on valueless stimulus-response associations. Confirmed by our computational hybrid framework, probability-magnitude integration deficits were driven specifically by a failure to represent reward magnitude.

We used a sequential decision task, while concurrently manipulating performance incentives, to ask if symptoms and traits of psychopathology decrease or increase model-based control in response to incentives. METHODS: We recruited a nonpatient population of 839 online participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk who completed transdiagnostic self-report measures encompassing symptoms, traits, and factors. We fit a dual-controller reinforcement learning model and obtained a computational measure of model-based control separately for small incentives and large incentives. RESULTS: None of the constructs were related to a failure of large incentives to boost model-based control. In fact, for the sensation seeking trait and anxious-depression factor, higher scores were associated with a larger incentive effect, whereby greater levels of these constructs were associated with larger increases in model-based control. Many constructs showed decreases in model-based control as a function of severity, but a social withdrawal factor was positively correlated; alcohol use and social anxiety were unrelated to model-based control. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that model-based control can reliably be improved independent of construct severity for most measures. This suggests that incentives may be a useful intervention for boosting model-based control across a range of symptom and trait severity.",,,,,"Patzelt, Edward/0000-0002-0534-5046; Gershman, Samuel/0000-0002-6546-3298; Millner, Alexander/0000-0001-6092-2857",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3223,1873-2402,,,,MAR 1,2019,85,5,,,,,425,433,,10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.06.018,,,,,,,WOS:000457543700008,30077331,,,,,

Previous studies investigating neonatal exposure to ambient fine and ultrafine particles have shown sex specific inflammation-linked pathological changes and protracted learning deficits. A potential contributor to the adverse phenotypes from developmental exposure to particulate matter observed in previous studies may be elemental carbon, a well-known contributor to pollution particulate. The present study is an evaluation of pathological and protracted behavioral alterations in adulthood following subacute neonatal exposure to ultrafine elemental carbon. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ultrafine elemental carbon at 50 mu g/m(3) from postnatal days 4-7 and 10-13 for 4h/day. Behavioral outcomes measured were locomotor activity, novel object recognition (short-term memory), elevated plus maze (anxiety-like behavior), fixed interval (FI) schedule of food reward (learning, timing) and differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) schedule of food reward (impulsivity, inability to inhibit responding). Neuropathology was assessed by measures of inflammation (glial fibrillary-acidic protein), myelin basic protein expression in the corpus callosum, and lateral ventricle area. Results: Twenty-four hours following the final exposure day, no significant differences in anogenital distance, body weight or central nervous system pathological markers were observed in offspring of either sex. Nor were significant changes observed in novel object recognition, elevated plus maze performance, FI, or DRL schedule-controlled behavior in either females or males. Conclusion: The limited effect of neonatal exposure to ultrafine elemental carbon suggests this component of air pollution is not a substantial contributor to the behavioral alterations and neuropathology previously observed in response to ambient pollution particulate exposures. Rather, other more reactive constituent species, organic and/or inorganic, gas-phase components, or combinations of constituents may be involved. Defining these neurotoxic components is critical to the formulation of better animal models, more focused mechanistic assessments, and potential regulatory policies for air pollution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1743-8977,,,,,FEB 18,2019,16,,,,,,,,10,10.1186/s12989-019-0293-5,,,,,,,WOS:000459220900001,30777081,,,,,

The experience and affective value of personal control may have particular relevance for psychiatric disorders, including depression. METHODS: We adapted a functional magnetic resonance imaging reward task that probed the value placed on exerting control over one's decisions, termed choice value, in 122 healthy participants. We examined activation associated with choice value; personally chosen versus passively received rewards; and reinforcement learning metrics, such as prediction error. Relationships were tested between measures of motivational orientation (categorized as autonomy, control, and impersonal) and subclinical depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Anticipating personal choice activated left insula, cingulate, right inferior frontal cortex, and ventral striatum (p(familywise error-corrected) < .05). Ventral striatal activations to choice were diminished in participants with subclinical depressive symptoms. Personally chosen rewards were associated with greater activation of the insula and inferior frontal gyrus, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and substantia nigra compared with rewards that were passively received. In participants who felt they had little control over their own behavior (impersonal orientation), prediction error signals in nucleus accumbens were stronger during passive trials. CONCLUSIONS: Previous findings regarding personal choice have been verified and advanced through the use of both reinforcement learning models and correlations with psychopathology. Personal choice has an impact on the extended reward network, potentially allowing these clinically important areas to be addressed in ways more relevant to personality styles, self-esteem, and symptoms such as motivational anhedonia.",,,,"McIntosh, Andrew M/B-9379-2008; Waiter, Gordon/AAA-1141-2020; Steele, Douglas/AAB-9889-2019; Shen, Xueyi/AAS-8960-2020","McIntosh, Andrew M/0000-0002-0198-4588; Steele, Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Shen, Xueyi/0000-0002-0538-4774; Sandu, Anca-Larisa/0000-0002-5555-4129; Murray, Alison/0000-0003-4915-4847; Waiter, Gordon/0000-0002-5313-9845",,,,,,,,,,,,2451-9022,2451-9030,,,,FEB,2019,4,2,,,,,190,199,,10.1016/j.bpsc.2018.09.015,,,,,,,WOS:000494386400011,30470583,,,,,

Even though RL methods achieved successes in increasingly large and complex problems, scaling solutions remains a challenge. One way to simplify (and consequently accelerate) learning is to exploit regularities in a domain, which allows generalization and reduction of the learning space. While object-oriented Markov decision processes (OO-MDPs) provide such generalization opportunities, we argue that the learning process may be further simplified by dividing the workload of tasks amongst multiple agents, solving problems as multiagent systems (MAS). In this paper, we propose a novel combination of OO-MDP and MAS, called multiagent OO-MDP (MOO-MDP). Our proposal accrues the benefits of both OO-MDP and MAS, better addressing scalability issues. We formalize the general model MOO-MDP and present an algorithm to solve deterministic cooperative MOO-MDPs.

However, this hypothesis, named the Opponent Actor Learning (OpAL), still has limitations. Structurally, the OpAL model does not incorporate differentiation of the two types of cortical inputs to the basal-ganglia pathways received from intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal-tract (PT) neurons. Functionally, the OpAL model does not describe the temporal-difference (TD)-type reward-prediction-error (RPE), nor explains how RPE is calculated in the circuitry connecting to the DA neurons. In fact, there is a different hypothesis on the basal-ganglia pathways and DA, named the Cortico-Striatal-Temporal-Difference (CS-TD) model. The CS-TD model differentiates the IT and PT inputs, describes the TD-type RPE, and explains how TD-RPE is calculated. However, a critical difficulty in this model lies in its assumption that DA induces the same direction of plasticity in both direct and indirect pathways, which apparently contradicts the experimentally observed opposite effects of DA on these pathways. Here, we propose a new hypothesis that integrates the OpAL and CS-TD models. Specifically, we propose that the IT-basal-ganglia pathways represent goodness/badness of current options while the PT-indirect pathway represents the overall value of the previously chosen option, and both of these have influence on the DA neurons, through the basal-ganglia output, so that a variant of TD-RPE is calculated. A key assumption is that opposite directions of plasticity are induced upon phasic activation of DA neurons in the IT-indirect pathway and PT-indirect pathway because of different profiles of IT and PT inputs. Specifically, at PT -> indirect-pathway-medium-spiny-neuron (iMSN) synapses, sustained glutamatergic inputs generate rich adenosine, which allosterically prevents DA-D2 receptor signaling and instead favors adenosine-A2A receptor signaling. Then, phasic DA-induced phasic adenosine, which reflects TD-RPE, causes long-term synaptic potentiation. In contrast, at IT -> iMSN synapses where adenosine is scarce, phasic DA causes long-term synaptic depression via D2 receptor signaling. This new Opponency and Temporal-Difference (OTD) model provides unique predictions, part of which is potentially in line with recently reported activity patterns of neurons in the globus pallidus externus on the indirect pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5110,,,,,JAN 7,2019,12,,,,,,,,111,10.3389/fncir.2018.00111,,,,,,,WOS:000455231700001,30687019,,,,,

While traffic laws are easily embedded into an artificial brain, modeling human complex behaviors which come from past experience is a more challenging task. One of these behaviors is the capability of communicating intentions and negotiating the right of way through driving actions, as when a driver is entering a crowded roundabout and observes other cars movements to guess the best time to merge in. In addition, each driver has its own unique driving style, which is conditioned by both its personal characteristics, such as age and quality of sight, and external factors, such as being late or in a bad mood. For these reasons, the interaction between different drivers is not trivial to simulate in a realistic manner. In this paper, this problem is addressed by developing a microscopic simulator using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm based on a combination of visual frames, representing the perception around the vehicle, and a vector of numerical parameters. In particular, the algorithm called Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic has been extended to a multi-agent scenario in which every agent needs to learn to interact with other similar agents.

Partly this success has been possible by progressing from simple experimental tasks to paradigms that incorporate more ecological features. More specifically, the premise is that to understand cognitions and brain functions relevant for real life, we need to introduce some of the ecological challenges that we have evolved to solve. This often entails an increase in task complexity, which can be managed by using computational models to help parse complex behaviours into specific component mechanisms. Here we propose that using computational models with tasks that capture ecologically relevant learning and decision-making processes may provide a critical advantage for capturing the mechanisms underlying symptoms of disorders in psychiatry. As a result, it may help develop mechanistic approaches towards diagnosis and treatment. We begin this review by mapping out the basic concepts and models of learning and decision-making. We then move on to consider specific challenges that emerge in realistic environments and describe how they can be captured by tasks. These include changes of context, uncertainty, reflexive/emotional biases, cost-benefit decision-making, and balancing exploration and exploitation. Where appropriate we highlight future or current links to psychiatry. We particularly draw examples from research on clinical depression, a disorder that greatly compromises motivated behaviours in real-life, but where simpler paradigms have yielded mixed results. Finally, we highlight several paradigms that could be used to help provide new insights into the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.",,,,,"Klein-Flugge, Miriam/0000-0002-5156-9833",,,,,,,,,,,,0166-4328,1872-7549,,,,DEC 14,2018,355,,,,SI,,56,75,,10.1016/j.bbr.2017.09.050,,,,,,,WOS:000446147100007,28966147,,,,,

Despite its prevalence and debilitating effects, treatments for anhedonia are lacking, primarily because its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dopamine (DA) has been implicated in anhedonia through its role in reward-related learning; glucocorticoid systems may also be involved in that anhedonia is often preceded by chronic stress. Objective This study investigated DA and glucocorticoid systems in anhedonia using a rat version of the probabilistic reward task (PRT). Methods Adult male Wistar rats were trained on the PRT and then tested following: (1) activation or inhibition of DA activity induced by amphetamine (AMPH) or pramipexole (PRAMI) injections, (2) chronic mild stress (CMS), or (3) glucocorticoid system activation (dexamethasone (DEX)) or inhibition (mifepristone (MIFE)). Results AMPH increased and PRAMI decreased response bias, pointing to enhanced and diminished reward responsiveness with DA agonism and antagonism, respectively. CMS reduced response bias but only in a subpopulation of rats. DEX also decreased response bias, suggesting that glucocorticoid processes contribute to anhedonia, although glucocorticoid inhibition (MIFE) had no effect. None of the manipulations altered the ability to detect and respond to reward-paired stimuli. Conclusions These results confirm a role of DA in anhedonia and elucidate the contribution of the glucocorticoid system to this effect. In addition, chronic stress may interfere with normal DA functioning, leading to impaired reward-related learning in some animals. These findings may direct future treatment of anhedonia by targeting DA and glucocorticoid systems, as well as a possible interaction between the two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0033-3158,1432-2072,,,,NOV,2018,235,11,,,,,3103,3113,,10.1007/s00213-018-5007-4,,,,,,,WOS:000448485500003,30136143,,,,,

Guided by computational frameworks, we formulated and tested two scenarios in which maladaptive representations of expected value should be most evident, thereby delineating conditions that may evoke decision-making impairments in schizophrenia. METHODS: In a modified reinforcement learning paradigm, 42 medicated people with schizophrenia and 36 healthy volunteers learned to select the most frequently rewarded option in a 75-25 pair: once when presented with a more deterministic (90-10) pair and once when presented with a more probabilistic (60-40) pair. Novel and old combinations of choice options were presented in a subsequent transfer phase. Computational modeling was employed to elucidate contributions from stimulus-response systems (actor-critic) and expected value (Q-learning). RESULTS: People with schizophrenia showed robust performance impairments with increasing value difference between two competing options, which strongly correlated with decreased contributions from expected value-based learning (Q-learning). Moreover, a subtle yet consistent contextual choice bias for the probabilistic 75 option was present in people with schizophrenia, which could be accounted for by a context-dependent reward prediction error in the actor-critic. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that decision-making impairments in schizophrenia increase monotonically with demands placed on expected value computations. A contextual choice bias is consistent with overreliance on stimulus-response learning, which may signify a deficit secondary to the maladaptive representation of expected value. These results shed new light on conditions under which decision-making impairments may arise.",,,,"Waltz, James/AAU-8304-2020","Waltz, James/0000-0002-9236-3719",,,,,,,,,,,,2451-9022,2451-9030,,,,NOV,2018,3,11,,,,,916,926,,10.1016/j.bpsc.2018.03.014,,,,,,,WOS:000494355900005,29735404,,,,,

However, little is known about how the availability of avoidance modulates learned threat responding. To assess this question, we recorded avoidance behaviour, electrodermal activity and expectancy ratings in 53 healthy participants during an associative learning paradigm with embedded unavoidable and avoidable trials. When avoidance was available, we observed greater avoidance behaviour for threat versus safety cues, as well as reduced differential skin conductance responses for unavoidable threat versus safety cues. When avoidance was unavailable, as during the extinction phase, we observed sustained differential skin conductance responses for threat versus safety cues. For all phases, we found greater expectancy ratings for threat versus safe cues. Furthermore, greater avoidance behaviour predicted larger differential skin conductance responses to threat versus safety cues during extinction.

It is closely linked with psychological well-being, and it is often concomitant with anxiety, negative affect, and in some cases even depressive disorders. In the case of musculoskeletal chronic pain, frequent physical activity is beneficial. However, reluctance to engage in physical activity is common due to negative psychological associations (eg, fear) between movement and pain. It is known that encouragement, self-efficacy, and positive beliefs are effective to bolster physical activity. However, given that the majority of time is spent away from personnel who can give such encouragement, there is a great need for an automated ubiquitous solution. Objective: MyBehaviorCBP is a mobile phone app that uses machine learning on sensor-based and self-reported physical activity data to find routine behaviors and automatically generate physical activity recommendations that are similar to existing behaviors. Since the recommendations are based on routine behavior, they are likely to be perceived as familiar and therefore likely to be actualized even in the presence of negative beliefs. In this paper, we report the preliminary efficacy of MyBehaviorCBP based on a pilot trial on individuals with chronic back pain. Methods: A 5-week pilot study was conducted on people with chronic back pain (N=10). After a week long baseline period with no recommendations, participants received generic recommendations from an expert for 2 weeks, which served as the control condition. Then, in the next 2 weeks, MyBehaviorCBP recommendations were issued. An exit survey was conducted to compare acceptance toward the different forms of recommendations and map out future improvement opportunities. Results: In all, 90% (9/10) of participants felt positive about trying the MyBehaviorCBP recommendations, and no participant found the recommendations unhelpful. Several significant differences were observed in other outcome measures. Participants found MyBehaviorCBP recommendations easier to adopt compared to the control (beta(int)=0.42, P<.001) on a 5-point Likert scale. The MyBehaviorCBP recommendations were actualized more (beta(int)=0.46, P<.001) with an increase in approximately 5 minutes of further walking per day (beta(int)=4.9 minutes, P=.02) compared to the control. For future improvement opportunities, participants wanted push notifications and adaptation for weather, pain level, or weekend/weekday. Conclusions: In the pilot study, MyBehaviorCBP's automated approach was found to have positive effects. Specifically, the recommendations were actualized more, and perceived to be easier to follow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an automated approach has achieved preliminary success to promote physical activity in a chronic pain context.

To test whether this model applies to more flexible learning regimes that require arbitrary sensorimotor associations, we developed a cerebellar-dependent motor learning task that is compatible with both mesoscale and single-dendrite-resolution calcium imaging in mice. We found that CFs were preferentially driven by and more time-locked to correctly executed movements and other task parameters that predict reward outcome, exhibiting widespread correlated activity in parasagittal processing zones that was governed by these predictions.

Participants had to estimate the probability of some fractal stimuli to be associated with a binary reward, based on a few passive observations. They then had to make a choice between one of the observed fractals and another target for which the reward probability was explicitly given. Computational modelling was used to succinctly describe participants' behaviour. Patients performed worse than controls at the task.

These advances have been spurred by brain-inspired architectures and algorithms such as hierarchical filtering and reinforcement learning. OpenAl Gym is an open-source platform in which to train, test, and benchmark algorithms-it provides a range of tasks, including those of classic arcade games such as Doom. Here we describe how the platform might be used as a simulation, test, and diagnostic paradigm for psychiatric conditions. METHODS: To illustrate how active inference models of game play could be used to test mechanistic and algorithmic properties of psychiatric disorders, we provide two exemplar analyses. The first speaks to the impact of aging on cognition, examining game-play behaviors in a model of aging in which we compared age-dependent changes of younger (n = 9, 22 +/- 1 years of age) and older (n = 7, 56 +/- 5 years of age) adult players. The second is an illustration of a putative feature of anhedonia in which we simulated diminished sensitivity to reward. RESULTS: These simulations demonstrate how active inference can be used to test predicted changes in both neurobiology and beliefs in psychiatric cohorts. We show that, as well as behavioral measures, putative neural correlates of active inference can be simulated, and hypothesized (model-based) differences in local field potentials and blood oxygen level-dependent responses can be produced. CONCLUSIONS: We show that active inference, through epistemic and value-based goals, enables simulated subjects to actively develop detailed representations of gaming environments, and we demonstrate the use of a principled algorithmic and neurobiological framework for testing hypotheses in psychiatric illness.",,,,"; Friston, Karl/D-9230-2011","Cullen, Maell/0000-0003-1168-5511; Friston, Karl/0000-0001-7984-8909; Moran, Rosalyn/0000-0002-2736-2621",,,,,,,,,,,,2451-9022,2451-9030,,,,SEP,2018,3,9,,,SI,,809,818,,10.1016/j.bpsc.2018.06.010,,,,,,,WOS:000494353300009,30082215,,,,,

Learning paradigms are increasingly being extended to study mood and psychiatric disorders as well as addiction. However, one potentially critical characteristic that this research ignores is the effect of time on learning: human feedback learning paradigms are usually conducted in a single rapidly paced session, whereas learning experiences in ecologically relevant circumstances and in animal research are almost always separated by longer periods of time. In our experiments, we examined reward learning in short condensed sessions distributed across weeks versus learning completed in a single massed session in male and female participants. As expected, we found that after equal amounts of training, accuracy was matched between the spaced and massed conditions. However, in a 3-week follow-up, we found that participants exhibited significantly greater memory for the value of spaced-trained stimuli. Supporting a role for short-term memory in massed learning, we found a significant positive correlation between initial learning and working memory capacity. Neurally, we found that patterns of activity in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex showed stronger discrimination of spaced-versus massed-trained reward values. Further, patterns in the striatum discriminated between spaced-and massed-trained stimuli overall. Our results indicate that single-session learning tasks engage partially distinct learning mechanisms from distributed training. Our studies begin to address a large gap in our knowledge of human learning from reinforcement, with potential implications for our understanding of mood disorders and addiction.",,,,"Gorgolewski, Krzysztof Jacek/A-7883-2010; Wimmer, G.

Dorsal hippocampus lesions showed a leftward shift (toward shorter durations) in peak-interval procedures, whereas ventral lesions shifted the peak time toward longer durations. We previously explained hippocampus lesion experimental findings by assuming a topological map model of the hippocampus with shorter durations memorized ventrally and longer durations more dorsal. Here we suggested a possible connection between the abstract topological maps model of the hippocampus that stored reinforcement times in a spatially ordered memory register and the time cells of the hippocampus. In this new model, the time cells provide a uniformly distributed time basis that covers the entire to-be-learned temporal duration. We hypothesized that the topological map of the hippocampus stores the weights that reflect the contribution of each time cell to the average temporal field that determines the behavioral response. The temporal distance between the to-be-learned criterion time and the time of the peak activity of each time cell provides the error signal that determines the corresponding weight correction. Long-term potentiation/depression could enhance/weaken the weights associated to the time cells that peak closer/farther to the criterion time.

Several dimensions of reward processing can be impacted, including reward valuation/salience, learning, expectancy and effort valuation. To establish the causal relationships between stress, brain changes, and reward processing pathologies, valid animal models are essential. Here, we present mouse experiments investigating behavioral effects of chronic social stress (CSS) in association learning tests of gustatory reward salience and effort valuation. The reward salience test (RST) comprised Pavlovian pairing of a tone with gustatory reward. The effort valuation test (EVT) comprised operant responding for gustatory reinforcement on a progressive ratio schedule (PRS). All testing was conducted with mice at 100% baseline body weight (BBW). In one experiment, mice underwent 15-day CSS or control handling (CON) and testing was conducted using sucrose pellets. In the RST on days 16-17, CSS mice made fewer feeder responses and had a longer tone response latency, than CON mice. In a shallow EVT on days 19-20, CSS mice attained a lower final ratio than CON mice. In a second CSS experiment, mice underwent CSS or CON and testing was conducted with chocolate pellets and in the presence of standard diet (low effort/low reward). In the RST on days 16-18, CSS mice made fewer feeder responses and had a longer tone response latency, than CON mice. In a steep EVT on days 19-20, CSS and CON mice attained less pellets than in the RST, and CSS mice attained a lower final ratio than CON mice. At day 21, blood levels of glucose and the satiety adipokine leptin were similar in CSS and CON mice. Therefore, CSS leads to consistent reductions in reward salience and effort valuation in tests based on association learning.

Preclinical studies have clarified that ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons encode RPE and habenular neurons encode punishment prediction error (PPE), which are then transmitted to the striatum and cortex to guide goal-directed behavior. However, few studies have probed striatal activation, and functional connectivity between VTA-striatum and VTA-habenula during reward and punishment learning respectively, in unmedicated MDD. To fill this gap, we acquired fMRI data from 25 unmedicated MDD and 26 healthy individuals during a monetary instrumental learning task and utilized a computational modeling approach to characterize underlying neural correlates of RPE and PPE. Relative to controls, MDD individuals showed impaired reward learning, blunted RPE signal in the striatum and overall reduced VTA-striatal connectivity to feedback. Critically, striatal RPE signal was increasingly blunted with more major depressive episodes (MDEs). No group differences emerged in PPE signals in the habenula and VTA or in connectivity between these regions. However, PPE signals in the habenula correlated positively with number of MDEs.

In the study reported here, hypotheses were extended to include distressed (Type D) personality which has been found to be related to BI. Type D personality is measured with the DS-14 scale which includes two subscales measuring negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI).

Here, we use reinforcement learning modelling to dissect out different contributions to the generalization of instrumental avoidance in two groups of human volunteers (N = 26, N = 482). We found that generalization of avoidance could be parsed into perceptual and value-based processes, and further, that value-based generalization could be subdivided into that relating to aversive and neutral feedback - with corresponding circuits including primary sensory cortex, anterior insula, amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Further, generalization from aversive, but not neutral, feedback was associated with self-reported anxiety and intrusive thoughts.

The administration of dopaminergic medications reverses this learning pattern. However, few studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of these cognitive processes. In this study, using fMRI, we tested a group of Parkinson's disease patients on and off dopaminergic medications and matched healthy individuals. All individuals completed an fMRI cognitive task that dissociates feedback learning from reward versus punishment. The administration of dopaminergic medications attenuated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses to punishment in the bilateral putamen, in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left premotor cortex. Further, the administration of dopaminergic medications resulted in a higher ratio of BOLD activity between reward and punishment trials in these brain areas. BOLD activity in these brain areas was significantly correlated with learning from punishment, but not from reward trials. Furthermore, the administration of dopaminergic medications altered BOLD activity in the right insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex when Parkinson's disease patients were anticipating feedback. These findings are in agreement with a large body of literature indicating that Parkinson's disease is associated with enhanced learning from punishment. However, it was surprising that dopaminergic medications modulated punishment learning as opposed to reward learning, although reward learning has been directly linked to dopaminergic function. We argue that these results might be attributed to both a change in the balance between direct and indirect pathway activation in the basal ganglia as well as the differential activity of D1 versus D2 dopamine receptors.",,,,"Sako, Wataru/AAH-9933-2020","Moustafa, Ahmed/0000-0001-5971-273X",,,,,,,,,,,,0959-4965,1473-558X,,,,MAY 2,2018,29,7,,,,,532,540,,10.1097/WNR.0000000000000970,,,,,,,WOS:000430475400003,29432300,,,,,

Although learning is considered to be the broad mechanism underlying placebo analgesia as well as nocebo hyperalgesia, critical differences have emerged in their specific mechanisms. One of the most interesting of these is that whereas placebo analgesia seems to be relatively short-lived, nocebo hyperalgesia appears more resistant to extinction, often persisting indefinitely. The current study examined why nocebo hyperalgesia persists longer than placebo analgesia. Sixty healthy volunteers were randomized to receive placebo conditioning, nocebo conditioning, or no conditioning using an experimental pain model with surreptitious decreases (placebo group) and increases (nocebo group) in pain stimulation paired with sham treatment during training. Pain was then assessed in a test phase with and without the sham treatment at equal pain stimulation. The conditioning procedure successfully induced placebo analgesia as well as nocebo hyperalgesia in the relevant groups, with nocebo hyperalgesia outlasting placebo analgesia, confirming nocebo hyperalgesia's resistance to extinction. Most interestingly, nocebo treatment led to heightened anticipatory anxiety ratings and autonomic arousal. Further, autonomic arousal completely mediated the effect of nocebo versus placebo training on extinction, suggesting that heightened autonomic arousal may be an important mechanism in the persistence of nocebo hyperalgesia. Perspective: Heightened anticipatory anxiety in the form of elevated autonomic arousal may explain why nocebo hyperalgesia persists relative to placebo analgesia. As such, interventions that reduce anticipatory anxiety could reduce the burden of persistent nocebo hyperalgesia.

AS is comprised of 3 empirically established factors, relating to fears of social concerns, fears of physical symptoms, and fears of cognitive dyscontrol. Relatively few studies have examined how these 3 subscales pertain to smoking processes. The aim of the present investigation was to examine, among treatment-seeking adults who smoke, the interactive effects of AS-physical and cognitive concerns in relation to: perceived barriers to smoking cessation; smoking-related negative reinforcement expectancies; and smoking-related avoidance and inflexibility. Methods: Participants included 470 adults who smoke (47.8% female; mean age 37.2, SD 13.5), who were recruited to participate in a smoking-cessation treatment study. At the baseline assessment, participants completed self-report measures, including the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, Barriers to Cessation Scale, Smoking Consequences Questionnaire, and Avoidance and Inflexibility Scale. Results: Results indicated that after controlling for the effects of sex, cigarette dependence, alcohol problems, tobacco-related medical illness, current axis 1 disorder, and AS-social concerns, a significant interaction emerged, such that the association between AS-cognitive concerns and the studied smoking-based cognitions were stronger among lower levels of AS-physical concerns (but not higher physical concerns).

Eyeblink classical conditioning is one method of examining associative learning biases independent of fear and threat produced by trauma. Facilitated learning is apparent in individuals self expressing PTSD symptoms, as well as behaviorally inhibited (BI) temperament, a vulnerability factor for PTSD. Here, we examine eyeblink conditioning in active duty military personnel and relate learning with PTSD symptomology. Method: Volunteers were 83 active duty United States Coast Guard personnel (18 females) recruited from small boat stations. Personnel were administered the PTSD Checklist (PCL) to assess current PTSD symptoms using DSM-IV criteria. BI temperament was assessed with the Adult Measure of Behavioural Inhibition (AMBI). Eyeblink conditioning was conducted using a partial reinforcement schedule, whereby paired trials (500-ms pure tone conditioned stimulus co-terminating with a 50-ms air-puff unconditional stimulus) were interpolated with 50% CS-alone trials. Results: Consistent with previous work, there was a high degree of concordance between BI and incidence of PTSD. Further, PTSD was associated with faster learning during the acquisition period, with conditioned responding sustained through the extinction period. Conclusions: These results reinforce the relationship between BI and PTSD in an active duty military sample, supporting previous observations in veteran and civilian samples. The conditioning data are consistent with predictions derived from a learning diathesis model of stress and anxiety, suggesting facilitated associative learning may represent an additional vulnerability for the development and maintenance of stress-related pathology.",,,,,"Servatius, Richard/0000-0002-7023-4895",,,,,,,,,,,,0166-4328,1872-7549,,,,FEB 26,2018,339,,,,,,106,113,,10.1016/j.bbr.2017.11.014,,,,,,,WOS:000424173300012,29154809,,,,,

However, motivated decisions are also guided by instrumental mechanisms, but to date the effect of traumatic stress on these instrumental systems remain poorly investigated. Here, we examine whether a single episode of severe traumatic stress influences flexible instrumental decisions through an impact on a Pavlovian system. Methods. Twenty-six survivors of the 2011 Norwegian terror attack and 30 matched control subjects performed an instrumental learning task in which Pavlovian and instrumental associations promoted congruent or conflicting responses. We used reinforcement learning models to infer how traumatic stress affected learning and decision-making. Based on the importance of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) for cognitive control, we also investigated if individual concentrations of Glx (= glutamate + glutamine) in dACC predicted the Pavlovian bias of choice. Results. Survivors of traumatic stress expressed a greater Pavlovian interference with instrumental action selection and had significantly lower levels of Glx in the dACC. Across subjects, the degree of Pavlovian interference was negatively associated with dACC Glx concentrations. Conclusions. Experiencing traumatic stress appears to render instrumental decisions less flexible by increasing the susceptibility to Pavlovian influences. An observed association between prefrontal glutamatergic levels and this Pavlovian bias provides novel insight into the neurochemical basis of decision-making, and suggests a mechanism by which traumatic stress can impair flexible instrumental behaviours.",,,,"Melinder, Annika/L-6782-2016","Melinder, Annika/0000-0001-7773-0579; Craven, Alexander R/0000-0003-2583-7571; Hugdahl, Kenneth/0000-0002-0008-4326",,,,,,,,,,,,0033-2917,1469-8978,,,,JAN,2018,48,2,,,,,327,336,,10.1017/S003329171700174X,,,,,,,WOS:000418740300014,28641601,,,,,

Learned helplessness, as a type of outcome learning, manifests in part as increases in escape latency in the face of repeated unpredicted shocks. Little is known about the mechanisms of outcome learning. When fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are exposed to unpredicted high temperatures in a place learning paradigm, flies both increase escape latencies and have a higher memory when given control of a place/temperature contingency. Here we describe discrete serotonin neuronal circuits that mediate aversive reinforcement, escape latencies, and memory levels after place learning in the presence and absence of unexpected aversive events.

However, aversive contexts in which we are required to update predictions of threat are often marked by stress. Acute stress is thought to reduce behavioral flexibility, yet its influence on the modulation of aversive value has not been well characterized. Given that stress exposure is a prominent risk factor for anxiety and trauma-related disorders marked by persistent, inflexible responses to threat, here we examined how acute stress affects the flexible updating of threat responses. Participants completed an aversive learning task, in which one stimulus was probabilistically associated with an electric shock, while the other stimulus signaled safety. A day later, participants underwent an acute stress or control manipulation before completing a reversal learning task during which the original stimulus-outcome contingencies switched. Skin conductance and neuroendocrine responses provided indices of sympathetic arousal and stress responses, respectively. Despite equivalent initial learning, stressed participants showed marked impairments in reversal learning relative to controls. Additionally, reversal learning deficits across participants were related to heightened levels of alpha-amylase, a marker of noradrenergic activity. Finally, fitting arousal data to a computational reinforcement learning model revealed that stress-induced reversal learning deficits emerged from stress-specific changes in the weight assigned to prediction error signals, disrupting the adaptive adjustment of learning rates.

While our basic knowledge of social systems has grown substantially, it has rarely been applied to human issues. Here, we attempted to bridge the gap between animal behaviour theory and human psychology by conducting social experiments involving fish. As in many species, minnows (family: Cyprinidae) repeatedly exposed to risky situations can develop a behavioural phenotype characterized by neophobic tendencies, pacing and stereotypic behaviours. Here, we tested whether the simple presence of calm (or un-calm) conspecific models could lead to a weakening of the high-risk phenotype in minnows that acquired fear either in isolation or within a group. We first documented that the social context of risk exposure impacted the intensity of the high-risk phenotype, with minnows exposed to risk in isolation showing stronger high-risk traits compared to those that were exposed to risk in groups. However, individuals exposed to risk in isolation were more influenced by calm models, despite their more pronounced phenotype. We argue that group exposure led to social reinforcement of risk, which in turn decreased the information transfer about safety in these individuals. We also demonstrate that a group of calm models, and not un-calm models, was required to weaken the high-risk phenotype. These findings highlight the interplay between social reinforcement of risk and safety in social groups and the impact of groups on information transmission. Moreover, our results parallel anecdotal reports of successes or failures of social therapies for post-traumatic stress (PTS) patients based on the social context of symptom acquisition, suggesting that understanding the transfer of information in social animals could prove fruitful in understanding and modelling PTS recovery.

Avoidance behavior-avoiding social situations for fear of embarrassment, for instance-is a core feature of such anxiety. However, as for many other psychiatric symptoms the biological mechanisms underlying avoidance remain unclear. METHODS: Reinforcement learning models provide formal and testable characterizations of the mechanisms of decision making; here, we examine avoidance in these terms. A total of 101 healthy participants and individuals with mood and anxiety disorders completed an approach-avoidance go/ no-go task under stress induced by threat of unpredictable shock. RESULTS: We show an increased reliance in the mood and anxiety group on a parameter of our reinforcement learning model that characterizes a prepotent (pavlovian) bias to withhold responding in the face of negative outcomes. This was particularly the case when the mood and anxiety group was under stress. CONCLUSIONS: This formal description of avoidance within the reinforcement learning framework provides a new means of linking clinical symptoms with biophysically plausible models of neural circuitry and, as such, takes us closer to a mechanistic understanding of mood and anxiety disorders.",,,,"Robinson, Oliver/B-3646-2011","Robinson, Oliver/0000-0002-3100-1132; Dayan, Peter/0000-0003-3476-1839; Roiser, Jonathan/0000-0001-8269-1228",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3223,1873-2402,,,,OCT 1,2017,82,7,,,,,532,539,,10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.01.017,,,,,,,WOS:000408871400012,28343697,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that anxious individuals may not appropriately differentiate between these situations. This investigation aims to precisely quantify the process deficit in anxious individuals and determine the degree to which these process dysfunctions are specific to anxiety. METHODS: One hundred twenty-two subjects recruited as part of an ongoing large clinical population study completed a change point detection task. Reinforcement learning models were used to explicate observed behavioral differences in low anxiety (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale score <= 8) and high anxiety (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale score >= 9) groups. RESULTS: High anxiety individuals used a suboptimal decision strategy characterized by a higher lose-shift rate. Computational models and simulations revealed that this difference was related to a higher base learning rate. These findings are better explained in a context-dependent reinforcement learning model. CONCLUSIONS: Anxious subjects' exaggerated response to uncertainty leads to a suboptimal decision strategy that makes it difficult for these individuals to determine whether an action is associated with an outcome by chance or by some statistical regularity. These findings have important implications for developing new behavioral intervention strategies using learning models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3223,1873-2402,,,,SEP 15,2017,82,6,,,SI,,440,446,,10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.07.007,,,,,,,WOS:000408154700010,28838468,,,,,

However, investigations of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at these synapses have been performed largely in brain slice preparations, without consideration of physiological reinforcement signals. This has led to conflicting findings, and hampered the ability to relate neural plasticity to behavior. Using intracellular striatal recordings in intact rats, we show here that pairing presynaptic and postsynaptic activity induces robust Hebbian bidirectional plasticity, dependent on dopamine and adenosine signaling. Such plasticity, however, requires the arrival of a reward-conditioned sensory reinforcement signal within 2 s of the STDP pairing, thus revealing a timing-dependent eligibility trace on which reinforcement operates. These observations are validated with both computational modeling and behavioral testing.

This negative self-reference is considered to be positively reinforced by rewarding experiences such as genuine support from others after negative self-disclosure, and negatively reinforced by avoidance of potential aversive situations. The learning account additionally predicts that negative self-reference would be maintained by an inability to adjust one's behavior when negative self-reference no longer leads to such reward. To test this prediction, we designed an adapted version of the reversal-learning task. In this task, participants were reinforced to choose and engage in either negative or positive self-reference by probabilistic economic reward and punishment. Although participants were initially trained to choose negative self-reference, the stimulus-reward contingencies were reversed to prompt a shift toward positive self-reference (Study 1) and a further shift toward negative self-reference (Study 2). Model-based computational analyses showed that depressive symptoms were associated with a low learning rate of negative self-reference, indicating a high level of reward expectancy for negative self-reference even after the contingency reversal. Furthermore, the difficulty in updating outcome predictions of negative self-reference was significantly associated with the extent to which one possesses negative self-images. These results suggest that difficulty in adjusting action-outcome estimates for negative self-reference increases the chance to be faced with negative aspects of self, which may result in depressive symptoms.",,,,,"Takano, Keisuke/0000-0003-0406-8654",,,,,,,,,,,,1664-1078,,,,,AUG 2,2017,8,,,,,,,,1333,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01333,,,,,,,WOS:000407357900001,28824511,,,,,

Reward prediction errors underlie learning of values in reinforcement learning models, are represented by phasic dopamine release, and are known to affect momentary mood. OBJECTIVE To combine functional neuroimaging, computational modeling, and smartphone-based large-scale data collection to test, in the absence of learning-related concerns, the hypothesis that depression attenuates the impact of RPEs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected on 32 individuals with moderate MDD and 20 control participants who performed a probabilistic reward task. A risky decision task with repeated happiness ratings as a measure of momentary mood was also tested in the laboratory in 74 participants and with a smartphone-based platform in 1833 participants. The study was conducted from November 20, 2012, to February 17, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Blood oxygen level-dependent activity was measured in ventral striatum, a dopamine target area known to represent RPEs. Momentary mood was measured during risky decision making. RESULTS Of the 52 fMRI participants (mean [SD] age, 34.0 [9.1] years), 30 (58%) were women and 32 had MDD. Of the 74 participants in the laboratory risky decision task (mean age, 34.2 [10.3] years), 44 (59%) were women and 54 had MDD. Of the smartphone group, 543 (30%) had a depression history and 1290 (70%) had no depression history; 918 (50%) were women, and 593 (32%) were younger than 30 years. Contrary to previous results in reinforcement learning tasks, individuals with moderate depression showed intact RPE signals in ventral striatum (z = 3.16; P = .002) that did not differ significantly from controls (z = 0.91; P = .36). Symptom severity correlated with baseline mood parameters in laboratory (rho = -0.54; P < 1 x 10(-6)) and smartphone (rho = -0.30; P < 1 x 10(-39)) data. However, participants with depression showed an intact association between RPEs and happiness in a computational model of momentary mood dynamics (z = 4.55; P < .001) that was not attenuated compared with controls (z = -0.42; P = .67). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The neural and emotional impact of RPEs is intact in major depression. These results suggest that depression does not affect the expression of dopaminergic RPEs and that attenuated RPEs in previous reports may reflect downstream effects more closely related to aberrant behavior. The correlation between symptom severity and baseline mood parameters supports an association between depression and momentary mood fluctuations during cognitive tasks. These results demonstrate a potential for smartphones in large-scale computational phenotyping, which is a goal for computational psychiatry.",,,,,"Fonagy, Peter/0000-0003-0229-0091; Lam, Jordan/0000-0003-3955-9031",,,,,,,,,,,,2168-622X,2168-6238,,,,AUG,2017,74,8,,,,,790,797,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.1713,,,,,,,WOS:000406930300007,28678984,,,,,

We focus here on two examples. First, cognitive neuroscience often distinguishes between habit and goal-directed reinforcement learning, in which only the latter is sensitive to proximal changes in behavior-environment contingencies. This distinction is relevant to RFT's original concerns about how rule-based processes can sometimes render an individual's behavior maladaptive to changing circumstances. Second, the discovery of neurophysiological structures associated with fear extinction and generalization can potentially yield new insights for derived relational responding research. In particular, we review how such work not only informs new ways of modifying the functions transformed in derived relational responding, but also new ways of measuring derived relational responding itself.

Despite social learning theory predicting that same sex models have greater effect, no experimental investigation to date has examined the role of sex of the model or observer in social learning of pediatric pain. The present study recruited 168 parent-child dyads (equal father-son, father-daughter, mother-son, and mother-daughter dyads) in which children were generally healthy and 6 to 8 years old. Unbeknownst to their child, parents were randomly assigned to exaggerate their expression of pain, minimize their expression of pain, or act naturally during the cold pressor task (CPT). Parents completed the CPT while their child observed, then children completed the CPT themselves. Children whose parents were in the exaggerate condition reported higher anxiety than children of parents in the minimize condition. Additionally, girls in the exaggerate condition rated their overall pain intensity during the CPT significantly higher than boys in the same condition. No child sex differences were observed in pain intensity for the control or minimize conditions. Parent expressions of pain affects children's anxiety, and sex-specific effects of parental exaggerated pain expression on children's own subsequent pain experience are present. Perspective: This article describes how parental expressions of pain influence children's pain and anxiety, specifically examining the relevance of parent and child sex in this process. These findings have implications for children of parents with chronic pain, or situations in which parents experience pain in the presence of their child (eg, vaccinations).

We thus aimed at comparing the neural coding of reward and punishment prediction errors, representing indicators of neural learning-related processes, between unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder and healthy participants. To this end, a group of unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder (n = 28) and a group of age-and sexmatched healthy control participants (n = 30) completed an instrumental learning task involving monetary gains and losses during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The two groups did not differ in their learning performance. Patients and control participants showed the same level of prediction error-related activity in the ventral striatum and the anterior insula. In contrast, neural coding of reward prediction errors in the medial orbitofrontal cortex was reduced in patients. Moreover, neural reward prediction error signals in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum showed negative correlations with anhedonia severity. Using a standard instrumental learning paradigm we found no evidence for an overall impairment of reinforcement learning in medication-free patients with major depressive disorder. Importantly, however, the attenuated neural coding of reward in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the relation between anhedonia and reduced reward prediction error-signalling in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum likely reflect an impairment in experiencing pleasure from rewarding events as a key mechanism of anhedonia in major depressive disorder.",,,,"Rothkirch, Marcus/J-8660-2016","Rothkirch, Marcus/0000-0001-7545-3432",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8950,1460-2156,,,,APR,2017,140,,4,,,,1147,1157,,10.1093/brain/awx025,,,,,,,WOS:000397319400033,28334960,,,,,

Methods : Animals (n= 8 swine) were implanted with a unilateral DBS electrode targeting the VTA. During stimulation (130 Hz frequency, 0.25 ms pulse width, and 3 V amplitude), fMRI was performed. Following fMRI, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in combination with carbon fiber microelectrodes was performed to quantify VTA-DBS-evoked dopamine release in the ipsilateral NAc. In a subset of swine, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) percent change evoked by stimulation was performed at increasing voltages (1, 2, and 3 V). Results : A significant increase in VTA-DBS-evoked BOLD signal was found in the following regions: the ipsilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate, insula, premotor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and striatum. A decrease in the BOLD signal was also observed in the contralateral parahippocampal cortex, dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortex, insula, inferior temporal gyrus, and primary somatosensory cortex (Bonferroni-corrected < 0.001). During neurochemical measurements, stimulation time-locked changes in dopamine release were recorded in the NAc, confirming that mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons were stimulated by DBS. In the parametric study, BOLD signal changes were positively correlated with stimulation amplitude. Conclusions : In this study, the modulation of the neural circuitry associated with VTA-DBS was characterized in a large animal. Our findings suggest that VTA-DBS could affect the activity of neural systems and brain regions implicated in reward, mood regulation, and in the pathophysiology of MDD. In addition, we showed that a combination of fMRI and electrochemically-based neurochemical detection platform is an effective investigative tool for elucidating the circuitry involved in VTA-DBS.",,,,"Min, Hoon-Ki/A-6025-2018; JO, HANG JOON/D-1775-2011","Min, Hoon-Ki/0000-0002-1084-2469; JO, HANG JOON/0000-0002-9180-3831; Settell, Megan/0000-0002-2924-360X",,,,,,,,,,,,1662-453X,,,,,MAR 3,2017,11,,,,,,,,104,10.3389/fnins.2017.00104,,,,,,,WOS:000395318500001,28316564,,,,,

Thus, it is relevant and timely to present a systematic review describing significant applications in the framework of computational intelligence-based SAS, including its performance, beneficial and challenging effects, and modeling for the decision-making on multiple scenarios. Methods: This study aims to systematically review the literature on systems for the detection and/or prediction of apnea events using a classification model. Results: Forty-five included studies revealed a combination of classification techniques for the diagnosis of apnea, such as threshold-based (14.75%) and machine learning (ML) models (85.25%). In addition, the ML models, were clustered in a mind map, include neural networks (44.26%), regression (4.91%), instance-based (11.47%), Bayesian algorithms (1.63%), reinforcement learning (4.91%), dimensionality reduction (8.19%), ensemble learning (6.55%), and decision trees (3.27%). Conclusions: A classification model should provide an auto-adaptive and no external-human action dependency. In addition, the accuracy of the classification models is related with the effective features selection.

Recent findings New data on incidence, persistence and severity add to studies of prevalence to indicate the large scale of the clinical need. A number of person characteristics have been repeatedly identified in prevalence and cohort studies that: can be considered as risk markers (e.g. stereotyped behaviour, autism spectrum disorder) and indicate possible causal mechanisms (e.g. sleep disorder, anxiety). Studies have started to integrate traditional operant learning paradigms with known person characteristics and reviews and meta-analyses of applied behaviour analytic procedures can now inform practice. Summary Despite these positive developments interventions and appropriate support falls far short of the required need. Expansions in applied research are warranted to develop and evaluate innovative service delivery models that can translate knowledge of risk markers and operant learning paradigms into widespread, low cost routine clinical practice. Alongside this, further pure research is needed to elucidate the direction of causality of implicated risk factors, in order to understand and intervene more effectively in self-injury.",,,,"; Oliver, Christopher/A-7519-2008","Richards, Caroline/0000-0002-5444-4147; Oliver, Christopher/0000-0001-5217-6209",,,,,,,,,,,,0951-7367,1473-6578,,,,MAR,2017,30,2,,,,,97,101,,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000313,,,,,,,WOS:000393777500007,28030375,,,,,

The large number of test variables with different mean variations and within and between test correlations often constitute a significant problem in determining essential variables to assess behavioral patterns and their variation in individual animals as well as appropriate statistical treatment. Therefore, we applied a multivariate approach (principal component analysis) to analyse the behavioral data of 162 male adult Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent a behavioral test battery including commonly used tests for spatial learning and memory (holeboard) and different behavioral patterns (open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim test) as well as for motor abilities (Rota rod). The high dimensional behavioral results were reduced to fewer components associated with spatial cognition, general activity, anxiety-, and depression-like behavior and motor ability. The loading scores of individual rats on these different components allow an assessment and the distribution of individual features in a population of animals. The reduced number of components can be used also for statistical calculations like appropriate sample sizes for valid discriminations between experimental groups, which otherwise have to be done on each variable. Because the animals were intact, untreated and experimentally naive the results reflect trait patterns of behavior and thus individuality. The distribution of animals with high or low levels of anxiety, depressive-like behavior, general activity and cognitive features in a local population provides information of the probability of their appeareance in experimental samples and thus may help to avoid biases. However, such an analysis initially requires a large cohort of animals in order to gain a valid assessment.",,,,"Engidawork, Ephrem/K-7551-2019; Engidawork, Ephrem/ABA-9193-2020","Engidawork, Ephrem/0000-0002-9931-6421",,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5153,,,,,FEB 17,2017,11,,,,,,,,26,10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00026,,,,,,,WOS:000394175300001,28261069,,,,,

As such, more nuanced models of the nature of these abnormalities are needed.

On the basis of previous research, several predisposing variables and vulnerability factors have been identified. These comprise psychopathological symptoms, such as depression and social anxiety, but also personality variables, such as impulsivity and self-esteem. Social cognitions, like perceived social support, stress vulnerability, and also genetic vulnerabilities are considered further potential predisposing variables. It is argued that predisposing variables act in concert with moderating and mediating variables in the development and maintenance of an Internet addiction. Dysfunctional coping style and Internet use expectancies are considered important in this context. In the course of reinforcement learning and conditioning processes, cue reactivity and craving is supposed to develop, which may interact with reduced executive functioning and inhibitory control. Future research should more explicitly investigate the interactions of certain variables, beyond addressing bivariate effects on a correlational or group-comparison level. The model suggested should be seen as a model in progress, which hopefully has the potential to inspire both future research and clinical practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2196-6605,2196-6613,978-3-319-46276-9; 978-3-319-46275-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,19,34,,10.1007/978-3-319-46276-9_2,10.1007/978-3-319-46276-9,,,,,,WOS:000419498600003,,,,,,

Methods: We examined the effect of negative conditioning on cognitive function and amygdala reactivity in 25 FND patients and 20 healthy volunteers (HV). Participants were first conditioned to stimuli paired with negative affective or neutral (CS+/CS-) information. During functional MRI, subjects then performed an instrumental associative learning task to avoid monetary losses in the context of the previously conditioned stimuli. We expected that FND patients would be better at learning to avoid losses when faced with negatively conditioned stimuli (increased harm avoidance). Multi-echo resting state fMRI was also collected from the same subjects and a robust denoising method was employed, important for removing motion and physiological artifacts. Results: FND subjects were more sensitive to the negative CS+ compared to HV, demonstrated by a reinforcement learning model. Contrary to expectation, FND patients were generally more impaired at learning to avoid losses under both contexts (CS+/CS-), persisting to choose the option that resulted in a negative outcome demonstrated by both behavioural and computational analyses. FND patients showed enhanced amygdala but reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responses when they received negative feedback. Patients also had increased resting state functional connectivity between these two regions. Conclusions: FND patients had impaired instrumental avoidance learning, findings that parallel previous observations of impaired action-outcome binding. FND patients further show enhanced behavioural and neural sensitivity to negative information. However, this did not translate to improved avoidance learning.

Anxiety-relieving drugs reduce these behaviors, and a rich psychological literature has addressed how personality traits dominated by BI predispose for anxiety disorders. Yet, a formal understanding of the cognitive inference and planning processes underlying anxiety-like BI is lacking. Here, we present and empirically test such formalization in the terminology of reinforcement learning. We capitalize on a human computer game in which participants collect sequentially appearing monetary tokens while under threat of virtual predation. First, we demonstrate that humans modulate BI according to experienced consequences. This suggests an instrumental implementation of BI generation rather than a Pavlovian mechanism that is agnostic about action outcomes. Second, an internal model that would make BI adaptive is expressed in an independent task that involves no threat. The existence of such internal model is a necessary condition to conclude that BI is under model-based control. These findings relate a plethora of human and nonhuman observations on BI to reinforcement learning theory, and crucially constrain the quest for its neural implementation.",,,,"Bach, Dominik/B-4302-2019","Bach, Dominik/0000-0003-3717-2036",,,,,,,,,,,,0096-1523,1939-1277,,,,JAN,2017,43,1,,,,,18,29,,10.1037/xhp0000282,,,,,,,WOS:000391573900003,27797550,,,,,

Most have focused on chronic patients with longstanding antipsychotic treatment, however, and studies of RL in early-illness patients have produced mixed results, particularly regarding gradual/procedural learning. No study has directly contrasted both rapid and gradual RL in first-episode psychosis (FEP) samples. We examined probabilistic RL in 34 FEP patients and 36 controls, using Go/NoGo (GNG) and Gain vs Loss-Avoidance (GLA) paradigms. Our results were mixed, with FEP patients exhibiting greater impairment in the ability to use positive, as opposed to negative, feedback to drive rapid RL on the GLA, but not the GNG. By contrast, patients and controls showed similar improvement across the acquisition. Finally, we found no significant between-group differences in the postacquisition expression of value-based preference in both tasks. Negative symptoms were modestly associated with RL measures, while the overall bias to engage in Go-responding correlated significantly with psychosis severity in FEP patients, consistent with striatal hyperdopaminergia. Taken together, FEP patients demonstrated more circumscribed RL impairments than previous studies have documented in chronic samples, possibly reflecting differential symptom profiles between first-episode and chronic samples. Our finding of relatively preserved gradual/procedural RL, in briefly medicated FEP patients, might suggest spared or restored basal ganglia function. Our findings of preserved abilities to use representations of expected value to guide decision making, and our mixed results regarding rapid RL, may reflect a lesser degree of prefrontal cortical functional impairment in FEP than in chronic samples.

Translational automated tests can be applied in humans and animals to study operant reward behaviour, aetio-pathophysiology underlying deficits therein, and effects of antidepressant treatment. Three inter-related experiments were conducted to investigate depression-relevant effects of chronic psychosocial stress on operant behaviour in mice. (A) Non-manipulated mice were trained on a complex reversal learning (CRL) test with sucrose reinforcement; relative to vehicle (VEH), acute antidepressant agomelatine (AGO, 25 mg/kg p.o.) increased reversals. (B) Mice underwent chronic social defeat (CSD) or control handling (CON) on days 1-15, and were administered AGO or VEH on days 10-22. In a progressive ratio schedule motivation test for sucrose on day 15, CSD mice made fewer responses; AGO tended to reverse this effect. In a CRL test on day 22, CSD mice completed fewer reversals; AGO tended to increase reversals in CSD mice associated with an adaptive increase in perseveration. (C) Mice with continuous operant access to water and saccharin solution in the home cage were exposed to CSD or CON; CSD mice made fewer responses for saccharin and water and drank less saccharin in the active period, and drank more water in the inactive period. In a separate CSD cohort, repeated AGO was without effect on these home cage operant and consummatory changes. Overall, this study demonstrates that psychosocial stress in mice leads to depression-relevant decreases in motivation and cognition in operant reward tests; partial reversal of these deficits by AGO provides evidence for predictive validity.

Consequently, the lack of training may lead to the progressive deterioration of motor function. Although Constraint-Induced Movement Therapies (CIMT) have shown to be effective in treating this condition, the method presents several limitations, and the high intensity of its protocols severely compromises its adherence. We propose a novel rehabilitation approach called Reinforcement-Induced Movement Therapy (RIMT), which proposes to restore motor function through maximizing arm use. This is achieved by exposing the patient to amplified goal-oriented movements in VR that match the intended actions of the patient. We hypothesize that through this method we can increase the patients self-efficacy, reverse learned non-use, and induce long-term motor improvements. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, longitudinal clinical study with 18 chronic stroke patients. Patients performed 30 minutes of daily VR-based training during six weeks. During training, the experimental group experienced goal-oriented movement amplification in VR. The control group followed the same training protocol but without movement amplification. Evaluators blinded to group designation performed clinical measurements at the beginning, at the end of the training and at 12-weeks follow-up. We used the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the upper extremities (UE-FM) (Sanford et al., Phys Ther 73:447-454, 1993) as a primary outcome measurement of motor recovery. Secondary outcome measurements included the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI-7) (Barreca et al., Arch Phys Med Rehabil 6:1616-1622, 2005) for measuring functional motor gains in the performance of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), the Barthel Index (BI) for the evaluation of the patient's perceived independence (Collin et al., Int Disabil Stud 10:61-63, 1988), and the Hamilton scale (Knesevich et al., Br J Psychiatr J Mental Sci 131:49-52, 1977) for the identification of improvements in mood disorders that could be induced by the reinforcement-based intervention. In order to study and predict the effects of this intervention we implemented a computational model of recovery after stroke. Results: While both groups showed significant motor gains at 6-weeks post-treatment, only the experimental group continued to exhibit further gains in UE-FM at 12-weeks follow-up (p < .05). This improvement was accompanied by a significant increase in arm-use during training in the experimental group. Conclusions: Implicitly reinforcing arm-use by augmenting visuomotor feedback as proposed by RIMT seems beneficial for inducing significant improvement in chronic stroke patients. By challenging the patients' self-limiting believe system and perceived low self-efficacy this approach might counteract learned non-use.",,,,,"Rubio Ballester, Belen/0000-0003-3496-5356; Maier, Martina/0000-0001-8898-5657",,,,,,,,,,,,,1743-0003,,,,AUG 9,2016,13,,,,,,,,74,10.1186/s12984-016-0178-x,,,,,,,WOS:000381338000001,27506203,,,,,

We examined the integrity of positive reinforcement learning in congenitally helpless (cH) rats, an animal model of depression, using a random ratio schedule and a devaluation-extinction procedure. Furthermore, we tested whether an antidepressant dose of the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor deprenyl would reverse any deficits in positive reinforcement learning. We found that cH rats (n = 9) were impaired in the acquisition of even simple operant contingencies, such as a fixed interval (FI) 20 schedule. cH rats exhibited no apparent deficits in appetite or reward sensitivity. They reacted to the devaluation of food in a manner consistent with a dose-response relationship. Reinforcer motivation as assessed by lever pressing across sessions with progressively decreasing reward probabilities was highest in congenitally non-helpless (cNH, n = 10) rats as long as the reward probabilities remained relatively high. cNH compared to wild-type (n = 10) rats were also more resistant to extinction across sessions. Compared to saline (n = 5), deprenyl (n = 5) reduced the duration of immobility of cH rats in the forced swimming test, indicative of antidepressant effects, but did not restore any deficits in the acquisition of a FI 20 schedule. We conclude that positive reinforcement learning was impaired in rats bred for helplessness, possibly due to motivational impairments but not deficits in reward sensitivity, and that deprenyl exerted antidepressant effects but did not reverse the deficits in positive reinforcement learning.

Here, we support the idea that basic dimensions of mental dysfunctions, such as alterations in reinforcement learning, can be identified, which interact with individual vulnerability and psychosocial stress factors and, thus, contribute to syndromes of distress across traditional nosological boundaries. We further suggest that computational modeling of learning behavior can help to identify specific alterations in reinforcement-based decision-making and their associated neurobiological correlates. For example, attribution of salience to drug-related cues associated with dopamine dysfunction in addiction can increase habitual decision-making via promotion of Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer as indicated by computational modeling of the effect of Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli (here affectively positive or alcohol-related cues) on instrumental approach and avoidance behavior. In schizophrenia, reward prediction errors can be modeled computationally and associated with functional brain activation, thus revealing reduced encoding of such learning signals in the ventral striatum and compensatory activation in the frontal cortex. With respect to negative mood states, it has been shown that both reduced functional activation of the ventral striatum elicited by reward-predicting stimuli and stress-associated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in interaction with reduced serotonin transporter availability and increased amygdala activation by aversive cues contribute to clinical depression; altogether these observations support the notion that basic learning mechanisms, such as Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer, represent a basic dimension of mental disorders that can be mechanistically characterized using computational modeling and associated with specific clinical syndromes across established nosological boundaries. Instead of pursuing a narrow focus on single disorders defined by clinical tradition, we suggest that neurobiological research should focus on such basic dimensions, which can be studied in and compared among several mental disorders.",,,,"Heinz, Andreas/ABB-7736-2020; Wackerhagen, Carolin/P-6069-2019","Wackerhagen, Carolin/0000-0002-5689-3472; Heinz, Andreas/0000-0001-5405-9065; Schlagenhauf, Florian/0000-0001-8340-5027",,,,,,,,,,,,0300-9564,1435-1463,,,,AUG,2016,123,8,,,SI,,809,821,,10.1007/s00702-016-1561-2,,,,,,,WOS:000380713100002,27145766,,,,,

Initial research has reported that the single presentation of a conditioned stimulus prior to extinction learning can permanently block the return of fear. However, only few studies have explored this issue and could not always replicate the findings. The present study examined human fear extinction using a four-day design. On the first day, two neutral stimuli were paired with electrical stimulation (UCS), while a third stimulus (CS-) was not. Twenty-four hours later, one conditioned stimulus (CS+(rem)) and the CS- were reminded once, 10 min before extinction learning, while the other conditioned stimulus (CS+(non-rem)) was not presented prior to extinction learning. All stimuli were presented during extinction learning and during two re-extinction sessions (24 h and 6-months after extinction learning) without reinforcement. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses and skin conductance responses (SCRs) to both CS+ and the CS- were explored during acquisition, extinction, and in both re-extinction sessions. Regarding SCRs, the results showed that a single presentation of a conditioned stimulus did not block the return of fear during re-extinction: Fear recovery during re-extinction (24 h and 6-months after extinction learning) was observed for both CS+ compared with the CS- with no difference between CS+(rem) and CS+(non-rem). Regarding BOLD-responses, no significant differences between CS+(rem) and CS+(non-rem) were found in region of interest (ROI)-analyses (amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) during extinction learning and both re-extinction sessions. Whole-brain analyses showed increased BOLD-responses to the CS+(non-rem) as compared to the CS+(rem) in several regions (e.g., middle frontal gyrus) during extinction learning and re-extinction (24 h after extinction learning). The present findings suggest that the effect of preventing the return of fear by disrupting reconsolidation seems to be a more labile phenomenon than previously assumed. Possible boundary conditions and implications are discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Using a rodent model of stress-based susceptibility to PTSD, we investigated the role of serotonin in this phenomenon. METHODS: Adult mice were exposed to repeated immobilization stress or handling, and the role of serotonin in subsequent fear learning was assessed using pharmacologic manipulation and western blot detection of serotonin receptors, measurements of serotonin, high-speed optogenetic silencing, and behavior. RESULTS: Both dorsal raphe serotonergic activity during aversive reinforcement and amygdala serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) activity during memory consolidation were necessary for stress enhancement of fear memory, but neither process affected fear memory in unstressed mice. Additionally, prior stress increased amygdala sensitivity to serotonin by promoting surface expression of 5-HT2CR without affecting tissue levels of serotonin in the amygdala. We also showed that the serotonin that drives stress enhancement of associative cued fear memory can arise from paired or unpaired footshock, an effect not predicted by theoretical models of associative learning. CONCLUSIONS: Stress bolsters the consequences of aversive reinforcement, not by simply enhancing the neurobiological signals used to encode fear in unstressed animals, but rather by engaging distinct mechanistic pathways. These results reveal that predictions from classical associative learning models do not always hold for stressed animals and suggest that 5-HT2CR blockade may represent a promising therapeutic target for psychiatric disorders characterized by excessive fear responses such as that observed in PTSD.",,,,"Kodandaramaiah, Suhasa/B-2844-2016","Kodandaramaiah, Suhasa/0000-0002-7767-2644; Goosens, Ki/0000-0002-5246-2261; Lin, Pei-Ann/0000-0003-4727-4407",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3223,1873-2402,,,,MAY 15,2016,79,10,,,,,814,822,,10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.06.025,,,,,,,WOS:000375074200010,26248536,,,,,

Prior studies of the habenula, a poorly understood nucleus in the dorsal diencephalon, suggest that projections to the medial habenula (MHb) regulate fear and anxiety responses, whereas the lateral habenula (LHb) is involved in the expression of learned helplessness, a model of depression. Tissue-specific deletion of the transcription factor Pou4f1 in the dorsal MHb (dMHb) results in a developmental lesion of this subnucleus. These dMHb-ablated mice show deficits in voluntary exercise, a possible correlate of depression. Here we explore the role of the dMHb in mood-related behaviors and intrinsic reinforcement. Lesions of the dMHb do not elicit changes in contextual conditioned fear. However, dMHb-lesioned mice exhibit shorter immobility time in the tail suspension test, another model of depression. dMHb-lesioned mice also display increased vulnerability to the induction of learned helplessness. However, this effect is not due specifically to the dMHb lesion, but appears to result from Pou4f1 haploinsufficiency elsewhere in the nervous system. Pou4f1 haploinsufficiency does not produce the other phenotypes associated with dMHb lesions. Using optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation, intrinsic reinforcement by the dMHb can be mapped to a specific population of neurokinin-expressing habenula neurons. Together, our data show that the dMHb is involved in the regulation of multiple mood-related behaviors, but also support the idea that these behaviors do not reflect a single functional pathway.",,,,"Turner, Eric/K-3556-2015","Turner, Eric/0000-0001-5499-6788; Hsu, Yun-Wei/0000-0001-7851-2733; Morton, Glenn/0000-0002-4823-3116",,,,,,,,,,,,2373-2822,,,,,MAY-JUN,2016,3,3,,,,,,,,10.1523/ENEURO.0109-16.2016,,,,,,,WOS:000391927300020,27482535,,,,,

Nevertheless, research typically focused on self-reported and psychophysiological measures of fear. Avoidance, which is overt behavior preventing the occurrence of an aversive (painful) stimulus, has been largely neglected so far. Therefore, we aimed to fill this gap and developed an operant conditioning procedure for pain-related avoidance behavior. Participants moved their arm to a target location using the HapticMaster (FCS Robotics; Moog Inc, East Aurora, New York), a 3 degrees-of-freedom, force-controlled robotic arm. Three movement trajectories led to the target location. If participants in the Experimental Group took the shortest/easiest trajectory, they always received a painful stimulus (T1 = 100% reinforcement; no resistance). If they deviated from this trajectory, the painful stimulus could be partly or totally prevented (T2 = 50% reinforcement; T3 = 0% reinforcement), but more effort was needed (T2 = moderate resistance and deviation; T3 = strongest resistance and largest deviation). The Yoked Group received the same reinforcement schedule irrespective of their own behavior. During the subsequent extinction phase, no painful stimuli were delivered. Self-reported pain-expectancy and pain-related fear were assessed, and avoidance behavior was operationalized as the maximal distance from the shortest trajectory. During acquisition, the Experimental Group reported more pain-related fear and pain-expectancy to T1 vs T2 vs T3 and deviated more from the shortest trajectory than the Yoked Group. During subsequent extinction, avoidance behavior, self-reported fear, and pain-expectancy decreased significantly, but conditioned differences persisted despite the absence of painful stimuli. To conclude, this operant learning task might provide a valid paradigm to study pain-related avoidance behavior in future studies.",,,,"Vlaeyen, Johan/P-9070-2019","Vlaeyen, Johan/0000-0003-0437-6665; Meulders, Ann/0000-0003-4250-3928",,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3959,1872-6623,,,,MAY,2016,157,5,,,,,1094,1104,,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000483,,,,,,,WOS:000378875600015,26761388,,,,,

However, very little is known about what distinguishes decision making by individuals with different disorders or the neuropsychological processes or brain systems underlying these. This is the focus of the current review. Scope and methodology: We first propose a neuroeconomic model of the decision-making process with separate stages for the prechoice evaluation of expected utility of future options; choice execution and postchoice management; the appraisal of outcome against expectation; and the updating of value estimates to guide future decisions. According to the proposed model, decision making is mediated by neuropsychological processes operating within three domains: (a) self-referential processes involved in autobiographical reflection on past, and prospection about future, experiences; (b) executive functions, such as working memory, inhibition, and planning, that regulate the implementation of decisions; and (c) processes involved in value estimation and outcome appraisal and learning. These processes are underpinned by the interplay of multiple brain networks, especially medial and lateralized cortical components of the default mode network, dorsal corticostriatal circuits underpinning higher order cognitive and behavioral control, and ventral frontostriatal circuits, connecting to brain regions implicated in emotion processing, that control valuation and learning processes. Findings and conclusion: Based on clinical insights and considering each of the decision-making stages in turn, we outline disorder-specific hypotheses about impaired decision making in four childhood disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD), depression, and anxiety. We hypothesize that decision making in ADHD is deficient (i.e. inefficient, insufficiently reflective, and inconsistent) and impulsive (biased toward immediate over delayed alternatives). In CD, it is reckless and insensitive to negative consequences. In depression, it is disengaged, perseverative, and pessimistic, while in anxiety, it is hesitant, risk-averse, and self-deprecating. A survey of current empirical indications related to these disorder-specific hypotheses highlights the limited and fragmentary nature of the evidence base and illustrates the need for a major research initiative in decision making in childhood disorders.

We judge the trustworthiness of partners in social interactions based on a number of partner characteristics as well as experiences with those partners. These decisions are also influenced by personality. The current study examined how the personality trait of behavioral inhibition, which involves the tendency to, avoid or withdraw from novelty in both social and non-social situations, is related to explicit ratings of trustworthiness' as well as decisions made in the trust game. In the game, healthy young adults interacted with three fictional partners who were portrayed as trustworthy, untrustworthy or neutral through biographical information. Participants could choose to keep $1 or send $3 of virtual money to then,choose to send $1.5 back a partner. The partner could to the participant or to keep the entire amount. On any trial in which the participant, chose to send, the partner always reciprocated with 50%. probability, irrespective of how that partner partner was portrayed in the biography. Behavioral inhibition was assessed, through was self report questionnaire.. Finally, a reinforcement learning computational model fit to the behavior of each participant. Self-reported ratings of trust confirmed that all participants, irrespective of behavioral inhibition, perceived differences in the moral character of the three Partners (trustworthiness of good > neutral > bad Partner) Decisions made in the game showed that inhibited participants tended to trust the neutral partner less than uninhibited Participants. In contrast, this was not reflected in the ratings of the neutral partner (either pre- or post-game), indicating a dissociation between ratings of trustworthiness and decisions made by inhibited Participants. Computational modeling showed that this was due to lower initial trust of the neutral partner rather than a higher learning rate associated with loss, suggesting an implicit bias against the neutral partner. Overall, the results suggest inhibited individuals may be predisposed to interpret neutral or ambiguous information more negatively which could, at least in part, account for the tendency to avoid unfamiliar people characterist of behaviorally inhibited temperament, as well as its relationship to anxiety disorders.",,,,"Myers, Catherine E./AAU-5804-2020","Myers, Catherine E./0000-0002-2776-4823",,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,FEB 8,2016,4,,,,,,,,e1631,10.7717/peerj.1631,,,,,,,WOS:000370933300002,27004148,,,,,

This has potential impact for mobile gambling technologies and responsible gambling interventions. Two laboratory models pertinent to this are the partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) and the trial spacing effect. Both of these might speed up or delay the acquisition and extinction of conditioned behavior. We report an experiment that manipulated the rate of reinforcement and inter trial interval (ITI) on a simulated slot machine where participants were given the choice between gambling and skipping on each trial, before perseverative gambling was measured in extinction, followed by measurements of the illusion of control, depression and impulsivity. We hypothesized that longer ITI's in conjunction with the low rates of reinforcement observed in gambling would lead to greater perseverance. We further hypothesized, given that timing is known to be important in displaying illusory control and potentially in persevering in gambling, that prior exposure to longer intervals might affect illusions of control. An interaction between ITI and rate of reinforcement was observed, as low reinforced gamblers with a long ITI gambled for longer. Respondents also displayed extinction and a PREE. Gamblers exposed to a higher rate of reinforcement gambled for longer in acquisition.

While behavioral interventions have been commonplace in the cognitive behavioral tradition, most often conceptualized within a cognitive theoretical framework, recent years have seen renewed interest in more purely behavioral models. These modern learning theory accounts of depression focus on the interchange between behavior and the environment, mainly in terms of lack of reinforcement, extinction of instrumental behavior, and excesses of aversive control, and include a conceptualization of relevant cognitive and emotional variables. These positions, drawn from extensive basic and applied research, cohere with biological theories on reduced reward learning and reward responsiveness and views of depression as a heterogeneous, complex set of disorders. Treatment techniques based on learning theory, often labeled Behavioral Activation ( BA) focus on activating the individual in directions that increase contact with potential reinforcers, as defined ideographically with the client.

Interests of chaotic models to study adult psychiatric disorders and developmental disorders,ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background. - Many clinical and biological parameters have nonlinear chaotic fluctuations. These variations result in unexpected pseudo-random transitions. In these models, few risk factors can lead to unexpected phenomena if oscillations and self-reinforcement patterns occur. Complex rhythms could ease the ability of a physiological system to adapt and react quickly to a constantly changing environment. Objectives. -It has been proposed that several psychiatric disorders and developmental disorders are characterized by a loss of complex rhythm in favor of a more organized pattern. We examine evidence to support these assumptions in literatures. Methods. - We performed a literature review of the main computerized databases (Medline, PubMed) and manual searches of the literature concerning non dynamic rhythms in time series analysis, in adults with psychiatric disorder and children with developmental disorder. These results were interpreted through a developmental approach that highlights the role of the learning process in the emergence of abilities. Results. - Analysis of clinical scores and electroencephalographic data have found that subjects with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, tested over a time series, have lower chaotic rhythms compared with healthy subjects. Growing children share several properties of a complex system: the interdependence of developmental axes (motor, emotional, language, social skills), multiple hierarchical levels (i.e. genetic, biological, environmental, and cultural), the two-way transactions between the child and his environment, and the sensitivity to initial conditions. This could explain the difficulty to predict the emergence of abilities or the long-term prognosis of impairment in children. This limitation is not only due to errors in the explanatory model or the lack of explanatory variable. It is also caused by instability, which is a core characteristic of a chaotic system. Conclusion. - The study of chaotic rhythms in time-series clinical and nonclinical data (e.g. EEG, functional neuroimaging) could improve the prediction of an acute event, such as relapse of mood disorder. Moreover, the complex rhythms in children may play a major part in synchronicity during interactions with a caregiver, held as essential for later development of self-regulation skills, such as emotional stability.

However, it remains unknown precisely which aspect of learning is impaired. In particular, learning from reward, or reinforcement learning, can be driven by two distinct computational processes. One involves habitual stamping-in of stimulus-response associations, hypothesized to arise computationally from 'model-free' learning. The other, 'model-based' learning, involves learning a model of the world that is believed to support goal-directed behaviour. Much work has pointed to a role for dopamine in model-free learning. But recent work suggests model-based learning may also involve dopamine modulation, raising the possibility that model-based learning may contribute to the learning impairment in Parkinson's disease. To directly test this, we used a two-step reward-learning task which dissociates model-free versus model-based learning. We evaluated learning in patients with Parkinson's disease tested ON versus OFF their dopamine replacement medication and in healthy controls. Surprisingly, we found no effect of disease or medication on model-free learning. Instead, we found that patients tested OFF medication showed a marked impairment in model-based learning, and that this impairment was remediated by dopaminergic medication. Moreover, model-based learning was positively correlated with a separate measure of working memory performance, raising the possibility of common neural substrates. Our results suggest that some learning deficits in Parkinson's disease may be related to an inability to pursue reward based on complete representations of the environment.",,,,,"Foerde, Karin/0000-0002-5804-9312",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8950,1460-2156,,,,FEB 1,2016,139,,2,,,,355,364,,10.1093/brain/awv347,,,,,,,WOS:000370205100016,26685155,,,,,

This chapter describes how computational psychiatry can provide a normative framework for emotions and an integrative approach to core cognitive components of depression and relapse. Central to this is the notion that emotions effectively imply a valuation; thus they are amenable to description and dissection by reinforcement-learning methods. It is argued that cognitive accounts of emotion can be viewed in terms of model-based valuation, and that automatic emotional responses relate to model-free valuation and the innate recruitment of fixed behavioral patterns. This model-based view captures phenomena such as helplessness, hopelessness, attributions, and stress sensitization. Considering it in more atomic algorithmic detail opens up the possibility of viewing rumination and emotion regulation in this same normative framework. The problem of treatment selection for relapse and recurrence prevention is outlined and suggestions made on how the computational framework of emotions might help improve this.

Instead of reaching an optimal decision based on the facts, we find it often easier and sometimes more useful to rely on hunches. In this work, we extend a previously developed model for such a mechanism where a simple neural associative memory was used to implement a visual recall system for a humanoid robot. In the model, the changes in the neural state consume ( neural) energy, and to minimize the total cost and the time to recall a memory pattern, the robot should take the action that will lead to minimal neural state change. To do so, the robot needs to learn to act rationally, and for this, it has to explore and find out the cost of its actions in the long run. In this study, a humanoid robot (iCub) is used to act in this scenario. The robot is given the sole action of changing his gaze direction. By reinforcement learning (RL) the robot learns which state-action pair sequences lead to minimal energy consumption. More importantly, the reward signal for RL is not given by the environment but obtained internally, as the actual neural cost of processing an incoming visual stimuli. The results indicate that reinforcement learning with the internally generated reward signal leads to non-trivial behaviours of the robot which might be interpreted by external observers as the robot's 'liking' of a specific visual pattern, which in fact emerged solely based on the neural cost minimization principle.",,,,"KIRTAY, Murat/AAT-3736-2020; Oztop, Erhan/K-8111-2012; Laschi, Cecilia/AAF-7982-2019","Oztop, Erhan/0000-0002-3051-6038; Laschi, Cecilia/0000-0001-5248-1043; Falotico, Egidio/0000-0001-8060-8080; KIRTAY, Murat/0000-0001-5524-8220",,,,,,,,,,,,2164-0572,,978-1-5090-4718-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,1101,1106,,,,,,,,,WOS:000403009300163,,,,,,

It is a frequently encountered problem in dental offices. Formulating acceptable evidence-based therapies for such patients is essential, or else they can be a considerable source of stress for the dentist. These patients need to be identified at the earliest opportunity and their concerns addressed. The initial interaction between the dentist and the patient can reveal the presence of anxiety, fear, and phobia. In such situations, subjective evaluation by interviews and self-reporting on fear and anxiety scales and objective assessment of blood pressure, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, finger temperature, and galvanic skin response can greatly enhance the diagnosis and enable categorization of these individuals as mildly, moderately, or highly anxious or dental phobics. Broadly, dental anxiety can be managed by psychotherapeutic interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of both, depending on the level of dental anxiety, patient characteristics, and clinical situations. Psychotherapeutic interventions are either behaviorally or cognitively oriented. Pharmacologically, these patients can be managed using either sedation or general anesthesia. Behavior-modification therapies aim to change unacceptable behaviors through learning, and involve muscle relaxation and relaxation breathing, along with guided imagery and physiological monitoring using biofeedback, hypnosis, acupuncture, distraction, positive reinforcement, stop-signaling, and exposure-based treatments, such as systematic desensitization, tell-show-do, and modeling. Cognitive strategies aim to alter and restructure the content of negative cognitions and enhance control over the negative thoughts. Cognitive behavior therapy is a combination of behavior therapy and cognitive therapy, and is currently the most accepted and successful psychological treatment for anxiety and phobia. In certain situations, where the patient is not able to respond to and cooperate well with psychotherapeutic interventions, is not willing to undergo these types of treatment, or is considered dental-phobic, pharmacological therapies such as sedation or general anesthesia should be sought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1179-1357,,,,,,2016,8,,,,,,35,50,,10.2147/CCIDE.S63626,,,,,,,WOS:000381874900002,27022303,,,,,

Recent preliminary evidence suggests that effects of yoga on cognitive and negative symptoms may drive this benefit. This study attempts to integrate evidence from neuroscience-based research, which focuses on the neuroplasticity-harnessing effects of yoga to bridge the schizophrenia connectopathy. In an overarching model to study putative neurobiological mechanisms that drive therapeutic effects of yoga, it is proposed that (a) various styles of meditation may help in strengthening the lateral and medial prefrontal brain networks, thus improving neurocognition and mentalizing abilities, and (b) learning and performing co-ordinated physical postures with a teacher facilitates imitation and the process of being imitated, which can improve social cognition and empathy through reinforcement of the premotor and parietal mirror neuron system.

Reinforcement learning describes how the brain can choose and value courses of actions according to their long-term future value. Some depressive symptoms may result from aberrant valuations, which could arise from prior beliefs about the loss of agency ('helplessness'), or from an inability to inhibit the mental exploration of aversive events. Predictive coding explains how the brain might perform Bayesian inference about the state of its environment by combining sensory data with prior beliefs, each weighted according to their certainty (or precision). Several cortical abnormalities in schizophrenia might reduce precision at higher levels of the inferential hierarchy, biasing inference towards sensory data and away from prior beliefs. We discuss whether striatal hyperdopaminergia might have an adaptive function in this context, and also how reinforcement learning and incentive salience models may shed light on the disorder.

A potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to focus on promising endophenotypes. Guided by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria initiative, we used source localization of scalp-recorded EEG resting data to examine the neural correlates of three emerging endophenotypes of depression: neuroticism, blunted reward learning, and cognitive control deficits. Data were drawn from the ongoing multi-site EMBARC study. We estimated intracranial current density for standard EEG frequency bands in 82 unmedicated adults with MDD, using Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography. Region-of-interest and whole-brain analyses tested associations between resting state EEG current density and endophenotypes of interest. Neuroticism was associated with increased resting gamma (36.5-44 Hz) current density in the ventral (subgenual) anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In contrast, reduced cognitive control correlated with decreased gamma activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), decreased theta (6.5-8 Hz) and alpha2 (10.5-12 Hz) activity in the dorsal ACC, and increased alpha2 activity in the right dlPFC. Finally, blunted reward learning correlated with lower OFC and left dlPFC gamma activity. Computational modeling of trial-by-trial reinforcement learning further indicated that lower OFC gamma activity was linked to reduced reward sensitivity. Three putative endophenotypes of depression were found to have partially dissociable resting intracranial EEG correlates, reflecting different underlying neural dysfunctions.

This observation may suggest that different underlying motivations for continued tobacco use across individuals and nicotine cessation may require different treatments in different individuals. Although most animal models of nicotine dependence emphasize the positive reinforcing effects of nicotine as the major motivational force behind nicotine use, smokers generally report that other consequences of nicotine use, including the ability of nicotine to alleviate negative affective states or cognitive impairments, as reasons for continued smoking. These states could result from nicotine withdrawal, but also may be associated with premorbid differences in affective and/or cognitive function. Effects of nicotine on cognition and affect may alleviate these impairments regardless of their premorbid or postmorbid origin (e.g., before or after the development of nicotine dependence). The ability of nicotine to alleviate these symptoms would thus negatively reinforce behavior, and thus maintain subsequent nicotine use, contributing to the initiation of smoking, the progression to dependence and relapse during quit attempts. The human and animal studies reviewed here support the idea that self-medication for pre-morbid and withdrawal-induced impairments may be more important factors in nicotine addiction and relapse than has been previously appreciated in preclinical research into nicotine dependence. Given the diverse beneficial effects of nicotine under these conditions, individuals might smoke for quite different reasons. This review suggests that inter-individual differences in the diverse effects of nicotine associated with self-medication and negative reinforcement are an important consideration in studies attempting to understand the causes of nicotine addiction, as well as in the development of effective, individualized nicotine cessation treatments.

However, it is unclear which components of the dopamine system contribute to which aspects of motor sequence learning. Here we used a genetic approach to investigate the relationship between different components of the dopamine system and specific aspects of sequence learning in humans. In particular, we investigated variations in genes that code for the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, the dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (DRD1 and DRD2). COMT and the DAT regulate dopamine availability in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum, respectively, two key regions recruited during learning, whereas dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are thought to be involved in long-term potentiation and depression, respectively. We show that polymorphisms in the COMT, DRD1 and DRD2 genes differentially affect behavioral performance on a sequence learning task in 161 Caucasian participants. The DRD1 polymorphism predicted the ability to learn new sequences, the DRD2 polymorphism predicted the ability to perform a previously learnt sequence after performing interfering random movements, whereas the COMT polymorphism predicted the ability to switch flexibly between two sequences. We used computer simulations to explore potential mechanisms underlying these effects, which revealed that the DRD1 and DRD2 effects are possibly related to neuroplasticity. Our prediction-error algorithm estimated faster rates of connection strengthening in genotype groups with presumably higher D1 receptor densities, and faster rates of connection weakening in genotype groups with presumably higher D2 receptor densities. Consistent with current dopamine theories, these simulations suggest that D1-mediated neuroplasticity contributes to learning to select appropriate actions, whereas D2-mediated neuroplasticity is involved in learning to inhibit incorrect action plans. However, the learning algorithm did not account for the COMT effect, suggesting that prefrontal dopamine availability might affect sequence switching via other, non-learning, mechanisms. These findings provide insight into the function of the dopamine system, which is relevant to the development of treatments for disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Our results suggest that treatments targeting dopamine D1 receptors may improve learning of novel sequences, whereas those targeting dopamine D2 receptors may improve the ability to initiate previously learned sequences of movements.

The occurrence of negative life events is associated with increased drinking (Keyes, Hatzenbuehler, & Hasin, 2011). Further, certain genotypes are more likely to drink alcohol in response to stressful negative life events (Blomeyer et al., 2008; Covault et al., 2007). Shared genetic factors may contribute to alcohol drinking and emotional reactivity, but this relationship is not currently well understood. We used an incentive downshift paradigm to address whether emotional reactivity is elevated in mice predisposed to drink alcohol. We also investigated if ethanol drinking is influenced in High Alcohol Preferring mice that had been exposed to an incentive downshift. Incentive downshift procedures have been widely utilized to model emotional reactivity, and involve shifting a high reward group to a low reward and comparing the shifted group to a consistently rewarded control group. Here, we show that replicate lines of selectively bred High Alcohol Preferring mice exhibited larger successive negative contrast effects than their corresponding replicate Low Alcohol Preferring lines, providing strong evidence for a genetic association between alcohol drinking and susceptibility to the emotional effects of negative contrast. These mice can be used to study the shared neurological and genetic underpinnings of emotional reactivity and alcohol preference. Unexpectedly, an incentive downshift suppressed ethanol drinking immediately following an incentive downshift. This could be due to a specific effect of negative contrast on ethanol consumption or a suppressive effect on consummatory behavior in general. These data suggest that either alcohol intake does not provide the anticipated negative reinforcement, or that a single test was insufficient for animals to learn to drink following incentive downshift. However, the emotional intensity following incentive downshift provides initial evidence that this type of emotional reactivity may be a predisposing factor in alcoholism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This theory holds that this process is conducted by two main controllers: a goal-directed system and a habitual system. In the reinforcement learning (RL) domain, the habitual behaviors are connected with model-free methods, in which appropriate actions are learned through trial-and-error experiences. However, goal-directed behaviors are associated with model-based methods of RL, in which actions are selected using a model of the environment. Studies on cognitive control also suggest that during processes like decision-making, some cortical and subcortical structures work in concert to monitor the consequences of decisions and to adjust control according to current task demands. Here a computational model is presented based on dual system theory and cognitive control perspective of decision-making. The proposed model is used to simulate human performance on a variant of probabilistic learning task. The basic proposal is that the brain implements a dual controller, while an accompanying monitoring system detects some kinds of conflict including a hypothetical cost-conflict one. The simulation results address existing theories about two event-related potentials, namely error related negativity (ERN) and feedback related negativity (FRN), and explore the best account of them.

Here we show that dopamine, a positive reinforcement signal, can retroactively convert hippocampal timing-dependent synaptic depression into potentiation. This effect requires functional NMDA receptors and is mediated in part through the activation of the cAMP/PKA cascade. Collectively, our results support the idea that reward-related signaling can act on a pre-established synaptic eligibility trace, thereby associating specific experiences with behaviorally distant, rewarding outcomes. This finding identifies a biologically plausible mechanism for solving the 'distal reward problem'.",,,,"Paulsen, Ole/ABB-4843-2020","Paulsen, Ole/0000-0002-2258-5455",,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,,,OCT 30,2015,4,,,,,,,,e09685,10.7554/eLife.09685,,,,,,,WOS:000373895600001,26516682,,,,,

Effect of induced happiness vs. sadness on probabilistic learning with vs. without exploration,FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"According to dominant neuropsychological theories of affect, emotions signal salience of events and in turn facilitate a wide spectrum of response options or action tendencies. Valence of an emotional experience is pivotal here, as it alters reward and punishment processing, as well as the balance between safety and risk taking, which can be translated into changes in the exploration exploitation trade-off during reinforcement learning (RL). To test this idea, we compared the behavioral performance of three groups of participants that all completed a variant of a standard probabilistic learning task, but who differed regarding which mood state was actually induced and maintained (happy, sad or neutral). To foster a change from an exploration to an exploitation based mode, we removed feedback information once learning was reliably established. Although changes in mood were successful, learning performance was balanced between the three groups. Critically, when focusing on exploitation-driven learning only, they did not differ either. Moreover, mood valence did not alter the learning rate or exploration per se, when titrated using complementing computational modeling. By comparing systematically these results to our previous study (Bakic et al., 2014), we found that arousal levels did differ between studies, which might account for limited modulatory effects of (positive) mood on RL in the present case. These results challenge the assumption that mood valence alone is enough to create strong shifts in the way exploitation or exploration is eventually carried out during (probabilistic) learning. In this context, we discuss the possibility that both valence and arousal are actually necessary components of the emotional mood state to yield changes in the use and exploration of incentives cues during RL.",,,,"De Raedt, Rudi/A-3269-2012","De Raedt, Rudi/0000-0001-6781-4808; JEPMA, MARIEKE/0000-0002-7903-0135; Pourtois, Gilles/0000-0002-5109-2801",,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5161,,,,,OCT 29,2015,9,,,,,,,,584,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00584,,,,,,,WOS:000366489600001,26578929,,,,,

In reinforcement learning, action values are increased when outcomes are better than predicted (positive prediction errors [PEs]) and decreased for worse than predicted outcomes (negative PEs). Because actions with high and low values are approached and avoided, respectively, individual differences in the neural encoding of PEs may influence the balance between approach-avoidance learning. Recent correlational approaches also indicate that biases in approach-avoidance learning involve hemispheric asymmetries in dopamine function. However, the computational and neural mechanisms underpinning such learning biases remain unknown. Here we assessed hemispheric reward asymmetry in striatal activity in 34 human participants who performed a task involving rewards and punishments. We show that the relative difference in reward response between hemispheres relates to individual biases in approach-avoidance learning. Moreover, using a computational modeling approach, we demonstrate that better encoding of positive (vs negative) PEs in dopaminergic midbrain regions is associated with better approach (vs avoidance) learning, specifically in participants with larger reward responses in the left (vs right) ventral striatum.

However, this disorder is commonly encountered in medical consultations and is discomforting and dysfunctional for both the child and the family. Most nighttime fears are part and parcel of normal development, and emanate from increasingly sophisticated cognitive development in the growing child. Thus, most children report a variety of coping strategies generally helpful in reducing their anxiety, which resolves spontaneously in the growing child. Nevertheless, in about 10% of children, nighttime fears are related to one or more anxiety disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. Then, it is estimated that severe nighttime fears and sleep problems occur in 20-30% of children. This problem is not transient and has to be treated. This study aims to review clinical features of nighttime fears and possible treatments for these patients and their families. Method. - This systematic review follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Two databases (Medline and Web of Science) were searched combining the search terms: nighttime fears AND children. English and French languages were imposed. There were no publication date or publication status limitations. Results. - Pathological nighttime fears are responsible for emotional (crying, panic, tantrums at bedtime, loss of confidence, self-disparaging negative statements, and feeling of social embarrassment) and behavioral (wandering alone in the house at night, calls for parental or sibling comfort, bed sharing with parents or siblings, light source at night, refusal to go to the toilet alone at night) disturbances. This leads to a poor quality of steep interfering with school learning, and also affects social development and family functioning. A full assessment has to be made to eliminate organic causes, have a baseline functioning, and search for comorbid anxiety diseases. The treatments which have proved effective are some cognitive-behavioral techniques: systematic desensitization (with relaxation or emotive imagery), reinforcement (gain of points and techniques of self statement), and cognitive techniques (reinforcing self-statements, reducing the aversive aspects of being in the dark, involving reality-testing statements, and active control are preferred in children older than 6 years, whereas the anti-monster letter and the techniques using a doll are preferred in children under 6 years old). The modelling technique seems to be appropriate at any age. Conclusion. - We have explained the clinical features of pathological nighttime fears and the way to assess this disease, and we have pointed out the treatments whose effectiveness has been evaluated in this indication.

Whereas some individuals tend to form a new memory during extinction, leaving their fear memory intact, others update the original threat association with new safety information, effectively unlearning the fear memory. We formalize this account in a computational model of fear learning and show that individuals who, according to the model, are more likely to form new extinction memories tend to show greater spontaneous recovery compared to individuals who appear to only update a single memory.

Johnston et al. use fMRI to test these predictions in subjects with treatment-resistant depression performing an instrumental learning task. The results largely support the hypotheses, particularly the observed correlation between hippocampal overactivity during loss events, and illness severity.Major depressive disorder is characterized by anhedonia, cognitive biases, ruminations, hopelessness and increased anxiety. Blunted responses to rewards have been reported in a number of recent neuroimaging and behavioural studies of major depressive disorder. In contrast, neural responses to aversive events remain an under-studied area. While selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors are often effective in treating major depressive disorder, their mechanism of action remains unclear. Following a series of animal model investigations of depressive illness and serotonergic function, Deakin and Graeff predicted that brain activity in patients with major depressive disorder is associated with an overactive dorsal raphe nucleus with overactive projections to the amygdala, periaqueductal grey and striatum, and an underactive median raphe nucleus with underactive projections to the hippocampus. Here we describe an instrumental loss-avoidance and win-gain reinforcement learning functional magnetic resonance imaging study with 40 patients with highly treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and never-depressed controls. The dorsal raphe nucleus/ periaqueductal grey region of the midbrain and hippocampus were found to be overactive in major depressive disorder during unsuccessful loss-avoidance although the median raphe nucleus was not found to be underactive. Hippocampal overactivity was due to a failure to deactivate during loss events in comparison to controls, and hippocampal over-activity correlated with depression severity, self-report 'hopelessness' and anxiety. Deakin and Graeff argued that the median raphe nucleus normally acts to inhibit consolidation of aversive memories via the hippocampus and this system is underactive in major depressive disorder, facilitating the development of ruminations, while the dorsal raphe nucleus system is engaged by distal cues predictive of threats and is overactive in major depressive disorder. During win events the striatum was underactive in major depressive disorder. We tested individual patient consistency of these findings using within-study replication. Abnormal hippocampal activity correctly predicted individual patient diagnostic status in 97% (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%) of subjects, and abnormal striatal activity predicted diagnostic status in 84% (sensitivity 79%, specificity 89%) of subjects. We conclude that the neuroimaging findings were largely consistent with Deaken and Graeff's predictions, abnormally increased hippocampal activity during loss events was an especially consistent abnormality, and brainstem serotonergic nuclei merit further study in depressive illness.",,,,"Christmas, David/C-7300-2011; Steele, J Douglas/A-8972-2017; Steele, Douglas/AAB-9889-2019","Christmas, David/0000-0002-6565-8722; Steele, J Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Steele, Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Matthews, Keith/0000-0002-4478-5888; Tolomeo, Serenella/0000-0003-0740-7893",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8950,1460-2156,,,,SEP 1,2015,138,,9,,,,2766,2776,,10.1093/brain/awv177,,,,,,,WOS:000361396200033,26133661,,,,,

Critically ill patients who are assisted by mechanical ventilators require moderate sedation for several days to ensure cooperative and safe treatment in the ICU, reduce anxiety and delirium, facilitate sleep, and increase patient tolerance to endotracheal tube insertion. However, most anesthetics affect cardiac and respiratory functions. Hence, it is important to monitor and control the infusion of anesthetics to meet sedation requirements while keeping patient vital parameters within safe limits. The critical task of anesthesia administration also necessitates that drug dosing be optimal, patient specific, and robust. In this paper, the concept of reinforcement learning (RL) is used to develop a closed-loop anesthesia controller using the bispectral index (BIS) as a control variable while concurrently accounting for mean arterial pressure (MAP). In particular, the proposed framework uses these two parameters to control propofol infusion rates to regulate the BIS and MAP within a desired range. Specifically, a weighted combination of the error of the BIS and MAP signals is considered in the proposed RL algorithm. This reduces the computational complexity of the RL algorithm and consequently the controller processing time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

During safety learning, the amygdala is under top-down inhibitory control by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The capacity of the PFC to exert inhibitory control over subcortical brain structures may be indexed by resting state vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV). The present study investigated the association of resting HRV with startle blink and SCR during conditioned fear inhibition and extinction. Participants first learned to discriminate a threat cue (A) signaling an aversive unconditioned stimulus from a safety signal (B), which were each presented together with a third stimulus X (AX+/BX-). Then, both the threat and safety signal were presented together (AB) to test whether the presence of the learned safety signal inhibits the fear response to the danger signal. Finally, AX was presented without reinforcement (AX-) to investigate fear extinction. Higher HRV was associated with pronounced fear inhibition and fear extinction. Resting HRV levels were associated with fear extinction as indexed by startle blink potentiation but not SCR, which presumably reflect more cognitive aspects of learning.

To address this apparent discrepancy, the present study determined whether both effects could be found in the same animals by performing localized 5-HT depletions in the amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of a New World monkey, the common marmoset. 5-HT depletion in the amygdala impaired response choice on a probabilistic visual discrimination task by increasing the effectiveness of misleading, or false, punishment and reward, and decreased response suppression in a variable interval test of punishment sensitivity that employed the same reward and punisher. 5-HT depletion in the OFC also disrupted probabilistic discrimination learning and decreased response suppression. Computational modeling of behavior on the discrimination task showed that the lesions reduced reinforcement sensitivity.

Furthermore, emotions are able to influence memory processing in a crucial way through the involvement of the amygdala. Our research aims to contribute to the neurobiological body of knowledge on acquisition and retrieval of emotional memory via the histaminergic amygdaloid system in mice. Objectives: The present study investigated whether exogenous HA infused into the amygdala differentially modulates the anxiety- and fear-related memory of mice assessed by unconditioned and conditioned tasks. Methods: Over two consecutive days, animals received bilateral microinjections of either vehicle or HA (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mu g by 0.1 mu l/side volume) into the amygdala before behavioral tests were performed. Mice were examined under two paradigms: an exposure/re-exposure procedure in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) or in the inhibitory avoidance (IA) with electric foot shock trials 1 and 2 and retention test (without foot shock). Results: Pre-test intra-amygdala microinjection of 0.5 mu g HA induced anxiolytic-like responses, but none of the three doses interfered in mnemonic processing examined in the EPM. Concerning the IA task, step-through retention latencies increased in all groups compared with their respective trials, except in the animals microinjected with 0.5 or 1.0 mu g HA before the retention test. Thus, HA caused statistically significant amnesia during the session repeated 24 h after training without drugs. Retention latency was not modified by microinjections of HA both pretrial and pre-test or by pre-trial infusion in mice subjected to IA. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the amygdaloid histaminergic system could modulate anxiety-related behaviors in the EPM and impair the retrieval process in fear conditioning with a strong aversive stimulus. These results contribute further evidence of the distinct histaminergic influence on different emotional pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our study found that parental modeling of the dangerousness of anxiety symptoms accounted for more model variance than from direct experiences with arousal-reactive symptoms or from parental reinforcement of the child's own sick role behavior when experiencing arousal reactive symptoms. We found that parental modeling independently predicted model variance even when perceived control was included in the model. Our results indicated that low perceived anxiety control and anxiety about bodily symptoms uniquely accounted for variance in the model. Our findings add to the growing body of research and suggest that anxiety about bodily symptoms and low perceived control together may interact to create a stronger distal vulnerability construct for panic than either construct alone in individuals whose childhood caregivers may have modeled fear of anxiety symptoms. The results of this study provide support for the inclusion of distal factors in unified cognitive vulnerability models of panic disorder as well as for future prospective research of these constructs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0147-5916,1573-2819,,,,AUG,2015,39,4,,,,,508,519,,10.1007/s10608-015-9673-9,,,,,,,WOS:000357658100009,,,,,,

Stimuli that signal safety from aversive events can paradoxically inhibit extinction of avoidance behavior. In animals, males and females process safety signals differently. These differences help explain why women are more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and exhibit differences in symptom presentation and course compared to men. In the current study, we extend an existing model of strain differences in avoidance behavior to simulate sex differences in rats. The model successfully replicates data showing that the omission of a signal associated with a period of safety can facilitate extinction in females, but not males, and makes novel predictions that this effect should depend on the duration of the period, the duration of the signal itself, and its occurrence within that period. Non-reinforced responses during the safe period were also found to be important in the expression of these patterns. The model also allowed us to explore underlying mechanisms for the observed sex effects, such as whether safety signals serve as occasion setters for aversive events, to determine why removing them can facilitate extinction of avoidance. The simulation results argue against this account, and instead suggest the signal may serve as a conditioned reinforcer of avoidance behavior.",,,,"Myers, Catherine E./AAU-5804-2020","Myers, Catherine E./0000-0002-2776-4823",,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,JUL 14,2015,3,,,,,,,,e1081,10.7717/peerj.1081,,,,,,,WOS:000358691000003,26213650,,,,,

A long-standing observation for lever press escape/avoidance learning in rats is the duration of the warning signal (WS) determines whether avoidance is expressed over escape. Outbred female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats trained with a 10-s WS efficiently escaped, but failed to exhibit avoidance; avoidance was exhibited to a high degree with WSs longer than 20-s. We examined this longstanding WS duration function and extended it to male SD and male and female WKY rats. A cross-over design with two WS durations (10 or 60 s) was employed. Rats were trained (20 trials/session) in four phases: acquisition (10 sessions), extinction (10 sessions), re-acquisition (8 sessions) and re-extinction (8 sessions). Consistent with the literature, female and male SD rats failed to express avoidance to an appreciable degree with a 10-s WS. When these rats were switched to a 60-s WS, performance levels in the initial session of training resembled the peak performance of rats trained with a 60-s WS. Therefore, the avoidance relationship was acquired, but not expressed at 10-s WS. Further, poor avoidance at 10-s does not adversely affect expression at 60-s. Failure to express avoidance with a 10-s WS likely reflects contrasting reinforcement value of avoidance, not a reduction in the amount of time available to respond or competing responses. In contrast, WKY rats exhibited robust avoidance with a 10-s WS, which was most apparent in female WKY rats. Exaggerated expression of avoidances by WKY rats, especially female rats, further confirms this inbred strain as a model of anxiety vulnerability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5153,,,,,JUL 6,2015,9,,,,,,,,168,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00168,,,,,,,WOS:000357877100001,26217200,,,,,

In humans, the role of social learning in avoidance of danger is still unknown, despite the fundamental importance of social learning for complex social behaviors. Critically, many social behaviors, such as cooperation and adherence to religious taboos, are maintained by threat of punishment. However, the psychological mechanisms allowing threat of punishment to generate such behaviors, even when actual punishment is rare or absent, are largely unknown. To address this, we used both computer simulations and behavioral experiments. First, we constructed a model where simulated agents interacted under threat of punishment and showed that mechanisms' (a) tendency to copy the actions of others through social learning, together with (b) the rewarding properties of avoiding a threatening punishment, could explain the emergence, maintenance, and transmission of large-scale behavioral traditions, both when punishment is common and when it is rare or nonexistent. To provide empirical support for our model, including the 2 mechanisms, we conducted 4 experiments, showing that humans, if threatened with punishment, are exceptionally prone to copy and transmit the behavior observed in others. Our results show that humans, similar to many nonhuman animals, use social learning if the environment is perceived as dangerous.

METHODS: Mothers of children between the ages of 8 and 15 years with and without IBS were identified through the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. Mothers completed questionnaires, including the Child Behavior Checklist (child psychological distress), the Family Inventory of Life Events (family exposure to stress), SCL-90R (mother psychological distress), and the Pain Response Inventory (beliefs about pain). Children were interviewed separately from their parents and completed the Pain Beliefs Questionnaire (beliefs about pain), Pain Response Inventory (coping) and Child Symptom Checklist [gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms]. In addition, health care utilization data was obtained from the automated database of Group Health Cooperative. Mothers with IBS (n = 207) and their 296 children were compared to 240 control mothers and their 335 children, while controlling for age and education. RESULTS: Hypothesis 1: reinforcement of expression of GI problems is only related to GI symptoms, but not others (cold symptoms) in children. There was no significant correlation between parental reinforcement of symptoms and child expression of GI or other symptoms. Hypothesis 2: modeling of GI symptomsis related to GI but not non-GI symptom reporting in children. Children of parents with IBS reported more non-GI (8.97 vs 6.70, P < 0.01) as well as more GI (3.24 vs 2.27, P < 0.01) symptoms. Total health care visits made by the mother correlated with visits made by the child (rho = 0.35, P < 0.001 for cases, rho = 0.26, P < 0.001 for controls). Hypothesis 3: children learn to share the methods of coping with illness that their mothers exhibit. Methods used by children to cope with stomachaches differed from methods used by their mothers. Only 2/16 scales showed weak but significant correlations (stoicism rho = 0.13, P < 0.05; acceptance rho = 0.13, P < 0.05). Hypothesis 4: mothers and children share psychological traits such as anxiety, depression, and somatization. Child psychological distress correlated with mother's psychological distress (rho = 0.41, P < 0.001 for cases, rho= 0.38, P < 0.001 for controls). Hypothesis 5: stress that affects the whole family might explain the similarities between mothers and their children. Family exposure to stress was not a significant predictor of children's symptom reports. Hypothesis 6: the intergenerational transmission of GI illness behavior may be due to multiple mechanisms. Regression analysis identified multiple independent predictors of the child's GI complaints, which were similar to the predictors of the child's non-GI symptoms (mother's IBS status, child psychological symptoms, child catastrophizing, and child age). CONCLUSION: Multiple factors influence the reporting of children's gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms.

Altered corticostriatothalamic encoding of reinforcement is a core feature of depression. Here we examine reinforcement learning in late-life depression in the theoretical framework of the vascular depression hypothesis. This hypothesis attributes the co-occurrence of late-life depression and poor executive control to prefrontal/cingulate disconnection by vascular lesions. Method. Our fMRI study compared 31 patients aged560 years with major depression to 16 controls. Using a computational model, we estimated neural and behavioral responses to reinforcement in an uncertain, changing environment (probabilistic reversal learning). Results. Poor executive control and depression each explained distinct variance in corticostriatothalamic response to unexpected rewards. Depression, but not poor executive control, predicted disrupted functional connectivity between the striatum and prefrontal cortex. White-matter hyperintensities predicted diminished corticostriatothalamic responses to reinforcement, but did not mediate effects of depression or executive control. In two independent samples, poor executive control predicted a failure to persist with rewarded actions, an effect distinct from depressive oversensitivity to punishment. The findings were unchanged in a subsample of participants with vascular disease. Results were robust to effects of confounders including psychiatric comorbidities, physical illness, depressive severity, and psychotropic exposure. Conclusions. Contrary to the predictions of the vascular depression hypothesis, altered encoding of rewards in late-life depression is dissociable from impaired contingency learning associated with poor executive control. Functional connectivity and behavioral analyses point to a disruption of ascending mesostriatocortical reward signals in late-life depression and a failure of cortical contingency encoding in elderly with poor executive control.",,,,"Aizenstein, Howard J/P-4432-2017","Aizenstein, Howard J/0000-0003-4897-6582; Dombrovski, Alexandre/0000-0002-2054-4772; Clark, Luke/0000-0003-1103-2422",,,,,,,,,,,,0033-2917,1469-8978,,,,MAY,2015,45,7,,,,,1413,1424,,10.1017/S0033291714002517,,,,,,,WOS:000351920000006,25319564,,,,,

Both human and non-human animal studies suggest that individual differences as well as various contextual cues may impact avoidance behavior. Specifically, we have recently shown that female sex and inhibited temperament, two anxiety vulnerability factors, are associated with greater duration and rate of the avoidance behavior, as demonstrated on a computer-based task closely related to common rodent avoidance paradigms. We have also demonstrated that avoidance is attenuated by the administration of explicit visual signals during non-threat periods (i.e., safety signals). Here, we use a reinforcement-learning network model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these empirical findings, with a special focus on distinct reward and punishment sensitivities. Model simulations suggest that sex and inhibited temperament are associated with specific aspects of these sensitivities. Specifically, differences in relative sensitivity to reward and punishment might underlie the longer avoidance duration demonstrated by females, whereas higher sensitivity to punishment might underlie the higher avoidance rate demonstrated by inhibited individuals. Simulations also suggest that safety signals attenuate avoidance behavior by strengthening the competing approach response. Last, several predictions generated by the model suggest that extinction-based cognitive-behavioral therapies might benefit from the use of safety signals, especially if given to individuals with high reward sensitivity and during longer safe periods. Overall, this study is the first to suggest cognitive mechanisms underlying the greater avoidance behavior observed in healthy individuals with different anxiety vulnerabilities.

The reflective system is prefrontally-mediated and uses working memory and executive attention to develop and test rules for classifying in an explicit fashion. The reflexive system is striatally-mediated and operates by implicitly associating perception with actions that lead to reinforcement. Although categorization is fundamental to auditory processing, little is known about the learning systems that mediate auditory categorization and even less is known about the effects of individual difference in the relative efficiency of the two learning systems. Previous studies have shown that individuals with elevated depressive symptoms show deficits in reflective processing. We exploit this finding to test critical predictions of the dual-learning systems model in audition. Specifically, we examine the extent to which the two systems are dissociable and competitive. We predicted that elevated depressive symptoms would lead to reflective-optimal learning deficits but reflexive-optimal learning advantages. Because natural speech category learning is reflexive in nature, we made the prediction that elevated depressive symptoms would lead to superior speech learning. In support of our predictions, individuals with elevated depressive symptoms showed a deficit in reflective-optimal auditory category learning, but an advantage in reflexive-optimal auditory category learning. In addition, individuals with elevated depressive symptoms showed an advantage in learning a non-native speech category structure. Computational modeling suggested that the elevated depressive symptom advantage was due to faster, more accurate, and more frequent use of reflexive category learning strategies in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms. The implications of this work for dual-process approach to auditory learning and depression are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While reinforcement learning (RL) models have been widely used to study the development of appetitive behaviors, less attention has been paid to avoidance. Here, we present a RL model of lever-press avoidance learning in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and in the inbred Wistar Kyoto (MY) rat, which has been proposed as a model of anxiety vulnerability. We focus on warm-up, transiently decreased avoidance responding at the start of a testing session, which is shown by SD but not WKY rats. We first show that a RL model can correctly simulate key aspects of acquisition, extinction, and warm-up in SD rats; we then show thatWKY behavior can be simulated by altering three model parameters, which respectively govern the tendency to explore new behaviors vs. exploit previously reinforced ones, the tendency to repeat previous behaviors regardless of reinforcement, and the learning rate for predicting future outcomes. This suggests that several, dissociable mechanisms may contribute independently to strain differences in behavior. The model predicts that, if the standard inter-session interval is shortened from 48 to 24 h, SD rats (but not MY) will continue to show warm-up; we confirm this prediction in an empirical study with SD and WKY rats. The model further predicts that SD rats will continue to show warm-up with inter-session intervals as short as a few minutes, while WKY rats will not show warm-up, even with inter-session intervals as long as a month. Together, the modeling and empirical data indicate that strain differences in warm-up are qualitative rather than just the result of differential sensitivity to task variables.

The reflective system uses working memory to develop and test rules for classifying in an explicit fashion, while the reflexive system operates by implicitly associating perception with actions that lead to reinforcement. Dual-learning systems models hypothesize that in learning natural categories, learners initially use the reflective system and, with practice, transfer control to the reflexive system. The role of reflective and reflexive systems in auditory category learning and more specifically in speech category learning has not been systematically examined. In this article, we describe a neurobiologically constrained dual-learning systems theoretical framework that is currently being developed in speech category learning and review recent applications of this framework. Using behavioral and computational modeling approaches, we provide evidence that speech category learning is predominantly mediated by the reflexive learning system. In one application, we explore the effects of normal aging on non-speech and speech category learning. Prominently, we find a large age-related deficit in speech learning. The computational modeling suggests that older adults are less likely to transition from simple, reflective, unidimensional rules to more complex, reflexive, multi-dimensional rules. In a second application, we summarize a recent study examining auditory category learning in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms. We find a deficit in reflective-optimal and an enhancement in reflexive-optimal auditory category learning.

Anatomical studies have shown that two types of corticostriatal neurons, intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) cells, preferentially project to dopamine D1 or D2 receptor-expressing striatal projection neurons, respectively. In contrast, an optogenetic study has shown that stimulation of IT axons evokes comparable responses in D1 and D2 cells and that stimulation of PT axons evokes larger responses in D1 cells. Since the optogenetic study applied brief stimulation only, however, the overall impacts of repetitive inputs remain unclear. Moreover, the apparent contradiction between the anatomical and optogenetic results remains to be resolved. I addressed these issues by using a computational approach. Specifically, I constructed a model of striatal response to cortical inputs, with parameters regarding short-term synaptic plasticity and anatomical connection strength for each connection type. Under the constraint of the optogenetic results, I then explored the parameters that best explain the previously reported paired-pulse ratio of response in D1 and D2 cells to cortical and intrastriatal stimulations, which presumably recruit different compositions of IT and PT fibers. The results indicate that 1) IT -> D1 and PT -> D2 connections are anatomically stronger than IT -> D2 and PT -> D1 connections, respectively, consistent with the previous findings, and that 2) IT -> D1 and PT -> D2 synapses entail short-term facilitation, whereas IT -> D2 and PT -> D1 synapses would basically show depression, and thereby 3) repetitive IT or PT inputs have larger overall impacts on D1 or D2 cells, respectively, supporting a recently proposed hypothesis on the roles of corticostriatal circuits in reinforcement learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3077,1522-1598,,,,JUL,2014,112,1,,,,,120,146,,10.1152/jn.00625.2013,,,,,,,WOS:000339172200012,24598515,,,,,

Worry is a particularly relevant emotion to study in the context of prospection because high levels of worry may make individuals more aversive toward the uncertainty associated with the prospect of obtaining future improvements in rewards or states. Thus, high levels of worry might lead to reduced prospection during decision-making and enhance preference for immediate over delayed rewards. In Experiment 1 participants performed a two-choice dynamic decision-making task where they were required to choose between one option (the decreasing option) which provided larger immediate rewards but declines in future states, and another option (the increasing option) which provided smaller immediate rewards but improvements in future states, making it the optimal choice. High levels of worry were associated with poorer performance in the task. Additionally, fits of a sophisticated reinforcement-learning model that incorporated both reward-based and state-based information suggested that individuals reporting high levels of worry gave greater weight to the immediate rewards they would receive on each trial than to the degree to which each action would lead to improvements in their future state. In Experiment 2 we found that high levels of worry were associated with greater delay discounting using a standard delay discounting task. Combined, the results suggest that high levels of worry are associated with reduced prospection during decision-making. We attribute these results to high worriers' aversion toward the greater uncertainty associated with attempting to improve future rewards than to maximize immediate reward. These results have implications for researchers interested in the effects of emotion on cognition, and suggest that emotion strongly affects the focus on temporal outcomes during decision-making.",,,,"Fields, Sherecce/L-3252-2013","Fields, Sherecce/0000-0002-6618-3394",,,,,,,,,,,,1664-1078,,,,,JUN 23,2014,5,,,,,,,,591,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00591,,,,,,,WOS:000338721300001,25002854,,,,,

Studies have drawn a complex picture of findings which demonstrated the sensitivity of this priming effect to a unique combination of variables, including, but not limited to, the type of relatedness between primes and targets, the prime-target Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA), the relatedness proportion (RP) in the stimuli list and the specific task subjects are required to perform. Automatic processes depending on the activation patterns of semantic representations in memory and controlled strategies adapted by individuals when attempting to maximize their recognition performance have both been implicated in contributing to the results. Lately, we have published a new model of semantic priming that addresses the majority of these findings within one conceptual framework. In our model, semantic memory is depicted as an attractor neural network in which stochastic transitions from one stored pattern to another are continually taking place due to synaptic depression mechanisms. We have shown how such transitions, in combination with a reinforcement-learning rule that adjusts their pace, resemble the classic automatic and controlled processes involved in semantic priming and account for a great number of the findings in the literature. Here, we review the core findings of our model and present new simulations that show how similar principles of parameter-adjustments could account for additional data not addressed in our previous studies, such as the relation between expectancy and inhibition in priming, target frequency and target degradation effects.

In awake, head-restricted mice, we applied electrical stimulation to the lateral hypothalamus, a reward-associated brain region, when whole-cell patch-clamped CA1 neurons exhibited spontaneous synaptic activity that met preset criteria. Within 15 min, the mice learned to generate frequently the excitatory synaptic input pattern that satisfied the criteria. This reinforcement learning of synaptic activity was not observed for inhibitory input patterns. When a burst unit activity pattern was conditioned in paired and nonpaired paradigms, the frequency of burst-spiking events increased and decreased, respectively. The burst reinforcement occurred in the conditioned neuron but not in other adjacent neurons; however, ripple field oscillations were concomitantly reinforced. Neural conditioning depended on activation of NMDA receptors and dopamine D-1 receptors. Acutely stressed mice and depression model mice that were subjected to forced swimming failed to exhibit the neural conditioning.

Typical and well studied examples of operant conditioning, in which the firing rates of individual cortical neurons in monkeys are increased using rewards, provide an opportunity for insight into this. Studies of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (RSTDP), and of other models such as R-max, have reproduced this learning behavior, but they have assumed that no unsupervised learning is present (i.e., no learning occurs without, or independent of, rewards). We show that these models cannot elicit firing rate reinforcement while exhibiting both reward learning and ongoing, stable unsupervised learning. To fix this issue, we propose a new RSTDP model of synaptic plasticity based upon the observed effects that dopamine has on long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD). We show, both analytically and through simulations, that our new model can exhibit unsupervised learning and lead to firing rate reinforcement. This requires that the strengthening of LTP by the reward signal is greater than the strengthening of LTD and that the reinforced neuron exhibits irregular firing. We show the robustness of our findings to spike-timing correlations, to the synaptic weight dependence that is assumed, and to changes in the mean reward. We also consider our model in the differential reinforcement of two nearby neurons.

We tested 22 healthy adult human participants in a within-subject, double-blind design in which participants were given Active or Sham stimulation over two sessions. We show Active stimulation had no effect on model-based control or on model-free ('habitual') control compared to Sham stimulation. These null effects are substantiated by a power analysis, which suggests that our study had at least 60% power to detect a true effect, and by a Bayesian model comparison, which favors a model of the data that assumes stimulation had no effect over models that assume stimulation had an effect on behavioral control. Although we cannot entirely exclude more trivial explanations for our null effect, for example related to (faults in) our experimental setup, these data suggest that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex does not improve model-based control, despite existing evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation can disrupt such control in the same brain region.",,,,"Diedrichsen, Jorn/AAQ-2242-2020; Diedrichsen, Jorn/A-7789-2010","Diedrichsen, Jorn/0000-0003-0264-8532; Diedrichsen, Jorn/0000-0003-0264-8532; FitzGerald, Thomas/0000-0002-3855-1591; Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JAN 24,2014,9,1,,,,,,,e86850,10.1371/journal.pone.0086850,,,,,,,WOS:000330339800064,24475185,,,,,

Elucidating the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is a precondition for moving from symptom-based to mechanism-based disorder classifications and ultimately mechanism-targeted interventions. However, despite substantial advances in basic research on decision-making and cognitive control, there are still profound gaps in our current understanding of dysfunctions of these processes in mental disorders. Central unresolved questions are: (i) to which degree such dysfunctions reflect transdiagnostic mechanisms or disorder-specific patterns of impairment; (ii) how phenotypical features of mental disorders relate to dysfunctional control parameter settings and aberrant interactions between large-scale brain systems involved in habit and reward-based learning, performance monitoring, emotion regulation, and cognitive control; (iii) whether cognitive control impairments are consequences or antecedent vulnerability factors of mental disorders; (iv) whether they reflect generalized competence impairments or context-specific performance failures; (v) whether not only impaired but also chronic over-control contributes to mental disorders. In the light of these gaps, needs for future research are: (i) an increased focus on basic cognitive-affective mechanisms underlying decision and control dysfunctions across disorders; (ii) longitudinal-prospective studies systematically incorporating theory-driven behavioural tasks and neuroimaging protocols to assess decision-making and control dysfunctions and aberrant interactions between underlying large-scale brain systems; (iii) use of latent-variable models of cognitive control rather than single tasks; (iv) increased focus on the interplay of implicit and explicit cognitive-affective processes; (v) stronger focus on computational models specifying neurocognitive mechanisms underlying phenotypical expressions of mental disorders.

Recent work suggests that these disturbances might be due to a deficit in actively using information to guide changes in behavior. However, how much information is actually used to guide behavior is difficult to observe directly. Therefore, we used a computational model to estimate the use of information during learning. Thirty-six female subjects were recruited based on their total scores on the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI), a self-report psychopathy list, and performed a task involving simultaneous learning of reward-based and social information. A Bayesian reinforcement-learning model was used to parameterize the use of each source of information during learning. Subsequently, we used the subscales of the PPI to assess psychopathy-related traits, and the traits that were strongly related to the model's parameters were isolated through a formal variable selection procedure. Finally, we assessed how these covaried with model parameters. We succeeded in isolating key personality traits believed to be relevant for psychopathy that can be related to model-based descriptions of subject behavior. Use of reward-history information was negatively related to levels of trait anxiety and fearlessness, whereas use of social advice decreased as the perceived ability to manipulate others and lack of anxiety increased. These results corroborate previous findings suggesting that sub-optimal use of different types of information might be implicated in psychopathy. They also further highlight the importance of considering the potential of computational modeling to understand the role of latent variables, such as the weight people give to various sources of information during goal-directed behavior, when conducting research on psychopathy-related traits and in the field of forensic psychiatry.",,,,"Brazil, Inti/Z-5180-2019; Brazil, Inti A/B-7224-2013; Kessels, Roy P.C./D-1902-2010; Mars, Rogier B./G-2312-2018","Brazil, Inti/0000-0001-5824-0902; Brazil, Inti A/0000-0001-5824-0902; Kessels, Roy P.C./0000-0001-9500-9793; Mars, Rogier B./0000-0001-6302-8631; Hunt, Laurence/0000-0002-8393-8533",,,,,,,,,,,,1664-1078,,,,,DEC 19,2013,4,,,,,,,,952,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00952,,,,,,,WOS:000331256600001,24391615,,,,,

Relative to non-depressive participants, we find that depressive participants' choices are better described by the simple RL model. Further, depressive participants were more exploratory than non-depressives in their decision-making.

An early form of LTP (E-LTP) can be reinforced into its late form (L-LTP) by various behavioral interactions within a specific time window (behavioral LTP-reinforcement). Depending on the type and procedure used, various studies have shown that stress differentially affects synaptic plasticity. Under low stress, such as novelty detection or mild foot shocks, E-LTP can be transformed into L-LTP in the rat dentate gyrus (DG). A reinforcing effect of a 2-min swim, however, has only been shown in (Korz and Frey (2003) J Neurosci 23:7281-7287; Korz and Frey (2005) J Neurosci 25:7393-7400; Ahmed et al.

We have reinvestigated these studies using the same as well as an improved recording technique which allowed the recording of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and the population spike amplitude (PSA) at their places of generation in freely moving rats. We show that acute swim stress led to a long-term depression (LTD) in baseline values of PSA and partially fEPSP. In contrast to earlier studies a LTP-reinforcement by swimming could never be reproduced. Our results indicate that 2-min swim stress influenced synaptic potentials as well as E-LTP negatively.

This study examined three questions: (1) What aspects of ethical sensitivity is altered in OCD?; (2) What is the relationship between ethical sensitivity and reversal learning?; (3) Are potential alterations in ethical sensitivity and reversal learning present in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)? Methods: Participants were 28 outpatients with OCD, 21 individuals with GAD, and 30 matched healthy controls. Participants received the Ethical Sensitivity Scale Questionnaire (ESSQ), rating scales for clinical symptoms, a reversal learning task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Results: We found higher ethical sensitivity scores in OCD compared with healthy controls in the case of generating interpretations and options and identifying the consequences of actions. Individuals with OCD displayed prolonged reaction times on probabilistic errors without shift and final reversal errors. Participants with GAD did not differ from healthy controls on the ESSQ but they were slower on reversal learning relative to nonpatients. In OCD, reaction time on final reversal errors mediated the relationship between ethical sensitivity and compulsions. WCST performance was intact in OCD and GAD.

We have extended these studies by analyzing strain differences in hippocampal gene expression following a frustrative experience involving reward downshift, i.e. instrumental successive negative contrast (iSNC), a phenomenon in which the sudden reduction of an expected reward induces frustration/anxiety. Food-deprived male Roman rats were exposed to a reduction in the amount of solid food presented in the goal of a straight alley (from 12 pellets in training trials - i.e. preshift trials- to 2 pellets in frustration testing trials i.e. postshift trials-). The iSNC effect, as measured by response latencies in the postshift trials, appeared only in RLA-I rats (i.e. higher response latencies in the 12-2 RLA-I group as compared to the 2-2 RLA-I control group in postshift trials). Two and a half hours after the postshift behavioral test, hippocampi were removed and stored (-80 degrees C) until analysis. Microarray analysis of these hippocampi showed that four differentially-expressed, and qRT-PCR-validated genes (TAAR2, THAP1, PKD2L1, NANOS), have relevance for brain function and behavior, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and drug addiction, thus showing the usefulness of Roman strains as a genetic model for research on the neurogenetic basis of frustration.

Could faulty estimation of these outcomes predispose to suicidal behavior? In behavioral studies, many of those who have attempted suicide misestimate expected rewards on gambling and probabilistic learning tasks. OBJECTIVES To describe the neural circuit abnormalities that underlie disadvantageous choices in people at risk for suicide and to relate these abnormalities to impulsivity, which is one of the components of vulnerability to suicide. DESIGN Case-control functional magnetic resonance imaging study of reward learning using a reinforcement learning model. SETTING University hospital and outpatient clinic. PATIENTS Fifty-three participants 60 years or older, including 15 depressed patients who had attempted suicide, 18 depressed patients who had never attempted suicide (depressed control subjects), and 20 psychiatrically healthy controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Components of the cortical blood oxygenation level-dependent response tracking expected and unpredicted rewards. RESULTS Depressed elderly participants displayed 2 distinct disruptions of control over reward-guided behavior. First, impulsivity and a history of suicide attempts (particularly poorly planned ones) were associated with a weakened expected reward signal in the paralimbic cortex, which in turn predicted the behavioral insensitivity to contingency change. Second, depression was associated with disrupted corticostriatothalamic encoding of unpredicted rewards, which in turn predicted the behavioral oversensitivity to punishment. These results were robust to the effects of possible brain damage from suicide attempts, depressive severity, co-occurring substance use and anxiety disorders, antidepressant and anticholinergic exposure, lifetime exposure to electroconvulsive therapy, vascular illness, and incipient dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Altered paralimbic reward signals and impulsivity and/or carelessness may facilitate unplanned suicidal acts. This pattern, also seen in gambling and cocaine use, may reflect a primary deficit in the paralimbic cortex or in its mesolimbic input. The overreactivity to punishment in depression may be caused in part by a disruption of appetitive learning in the corticostriatothalamic circuits.",,,,"Szanto, Katalin/B-8389-2014","Dombrovski, Alexandre/0000-0002-2054-4772; Clark, Luke/0000-0003-1103-2422",,,,,,,,,,,,2168-622X,2168-6238,,,,OCT,2013,70,10,,,,,1020,1030,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.75,,,,,,,WOS:000325184100006,23925710,,,,,

This avoidance may represent a general learning bias; indeed, individuals with PTSD are often faster than controls on acquiring conditioned responses based on physiologically-aversive feedback. However, it is not clear whether this learning bias extends to cognitive feedback, or to learning from both reward and punishment. Here, male veterans with self-reported current, severe PTSD symptoms (PTSS group) or with few or no PTSD symptoms (control group) completed a probabilistic classification task that included both reward-based and punishment-based trials, where feedback could take the form of reward, punishment, or an ambiguous no-feedback outcome that could signal either successful avoidance of punishment or failure to obtain reward. The PTSS group outperformed the control group in total points obtained; the PTSS group specifically performed better than the control group on reward-based trials, with no difference on punishment-based trials. To better understand possible mechanisms underlying observed performance, we used a reinforcement learning model of the task, and applied maximum likelihood estimation techniques to derive estimated parameters describing individual participants' behavior. Estimations of the reinforcement value of the no-feedback outcome were significantly greater in the control group than the PTSS group, suggesting that the control group was more likely to value this outcome as positively reinforcing (i.e., signaling successful avoidance of punishment). This is consistent with the control group's generally poorer performance on reward trials, where reward feedback was to be obtained in preference to the no-feedback outcome. Differences in the interpretation of ambiguous feedback may contribute to the facilitated reinforcement learning often observed in PTSD patients, and may in turn provide new insight into how pathological behaviors are acquired and maintained in PTSD.",,,,"Myers, Catherine E./AAU-5804-2020","Myers, Catherine E./0000-0002-2776-4823; Moustafa, Ahmed/0000-0001-5971-273X; Servatius, Richard/0000-0002-7023-4895",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,AUG 27,2013,8,8,,,,,,,e72508,10.1371/journal.pone.0072508,,,,,,,WOS:000323815200045,24015254,,,,,

The authors argue that these models connect to a phenomenon that may explain why symptoms of behavioral excess (e.g. rumination) often occur in depression that is otherwise marked by symptoms of behavioral deficit (e.g. anhedonia). Specifically, the authors illustrate that that concept of schedule strain (or low rates of response contingent reinforcement giving rise to low frequencies of behavior) unites these models. Depression is more likely, or more severe, when schedule strain conditions occur in situations containing reinforcers important to the individual and/or when they simultaneously occur in a number of situations. Conditions of schedule strain are known to give rise to adjunctive behaviors: apparently irrelevant, easy behaviors that deliver immediate reinforcement. This paper suggests that, for some depressed individuals, behavioral excess symptoms like rumination and overeating might serve adjunctive functions. Implications of this hypothesis are discussed.

Synaptic plasticity in the striatum of the basal ganglia is a cellular mechanism implicated in learning and neuronal information processing. Therefore, understanding how different spatio-temporal patterns of synaptic input select for different types of plasticity is key to understanding learning mechanisms. In striatal medium spiny projection neurons (MSPN), both long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) require an elevation in intracellular calcium concentration; however, it is unknown how the post-synaptic neuron discriminates between different patterns of calcium influx. Using computer modeling, we investigate the hypothesis that temporal pattern of stimulation can select for either endocannabinoid production (for LTD) or protein kinase C (PKC) activation (for LTP) in striatal MSPNs. We implement a stochastic model of the post-synaptic signaling pathways in a dendrite with one or more diffusionally coupled spines. The model is validated by comparison to experiments measuring endocannabinoid-dependent depolarization induced suppression of inhibition. Using the validated model, simulations demonstrate that theta burst stimulation, which produces LTP, increases the activation of PKC as compared to 20 Hz stimulation, which produces LTD. The model prediction that PKC activation is required for theta burst LTP is confirmed experimentally. Using the ratio of PKC to endocannabinoid production as an index of plasticity direction, model simulations demonstrate that LTP exhibits spine level spatial specificity, whereas LTD is more diffuse. These results suggest that spatio-temporal control of striatal information processing employs these Gq coupled pathways.",,,,"Kim, BoHung/D-2848-2011","Kim, BoHung/0000-0002-2280-2018; Blackwell, Kim/0000-0003-4711-2344",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7358,,,,MAR,2013,9,3,,,,,,,e1002953,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002953,,,,,,,WOS:000316864200026,23516346,,,,,

These cross-syndrome differences in prevalence warrant explanation, not least because this observation challenges an exclusively operant learning theory account. To explore this possible conflict between theoretical account and empirical observation, we describe the genetic cause and physical, social, cognitive and behavioral phenotypes of four disorders associated with ID (Angleman, Cornelia de Lange, Prader-Willi and Smith-Magenis syndromes) and focus on the behaviors of clinical significance in each syndrome.

In each syndrome it is possible to identify pathways from gene to physical phenotype to cognitive or motivational endophenotype to behavior to environment and back to behavior.

However, once acquired, emotional associations are not always expressed. The regulation of emotional responses under different environmental conditions is essential for mental health. Indeed, pathologic feelings of fear and anxiety are defining features of many serious psychiatric illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobias. The simplest form of regulation of emotional responses is extinction, in which the conditioned response to a stimulus decreases when reinforcement (stimulus) is omitted. In addition to modulating basal anxiety states, recent studies suggest an important role for the endocannabinoid (eCB) and glucocorticoid systems in the modulation of emotional states and extinction of aversive memories in animals. The purpose of this review is to briefly outline the animal models of fear extinction and to describe how these have been used to examine the potential of extinction enhancing agents which specifically alter the eCB and glucocorticoid systems. Pharmacological manipulations of these systems by agents such as cannabinoid or glucocorticoid agonists can enhance the extinction process and avoid the retention of memories which have the potential to trigger trauma. A better understanding of these findings through animal models highlights the possibilities of using combined extinction enhancing agents in exposure-based psychotherapies for anxiety disorders related to inappropriate retention of aversive memories.

Thirty children and adolescents diagnosed with ASD and 29 age-and intelligence quotient-matched controls completed a reversal learning paradigm following partial reinforcement Pavlovian fear conditioning, using a surprising air puff as the unconditioned stimulus. After initial reversal of cue contingencies, where a previously safe cue now predicted the air puff threat, the control group but not the ASD group responded more strongly to the new threat cue. The ASD group showed evidence for reversal learning only during later trials. Reversal learning in the ASD group was significantly negatively correlated with everyday symptoms of behavioral inflexibility but not with everyday anxiety.

We have proposed several variants of an animal model of depression based on extinction of reinforced behavior of rats. A number of behaviors emitted during extinction trials were found to be attenuated by antidepressant treatment and, thus, qualified as indices of extinction-induced despair. These include increases in immobility in the Morris water maze and withdrawal from the former source of reward as well as biting behavior in operant chambers. Here, we assess the effects of reward omission on behaviors after learning of (a) a cued free-reward delivery in an operant chamber and (b) food-reinforced runway behavior. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were either trained to receive food reinforcement every 90 s (s) after a 5 s lasting cue light (FI 90), or to traverse an alley to gain food reward. Daily drug treatment with either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram or the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (each 10 mg/kg) or vehicle was begun either 25 days (operant chamber) or 3 days (runway) prior to extinction. The antidepressants suppressed rearing behavior in both paradigms specifically during the extinction trials, which indicates this measure as a useful marker of depression-related behavior, possibly indicating vertical withdrawal. In the operant chamber, only marginal effects on operant learning responses during extinction were found. In the runway, the operant learned responses run time and distance to the goal, as well as total distance moved, grooming and quiescence were also influenced by the antidepressants, providing a potential set of markers for extinction-induced depression in the runway. Both paradigms differ substantially with respect to the anticipation of reward, behaviors that are learned and that accompany extinction. Accordingly, antidepressant treatment influenced different sets of behaviors in these two learning tasks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding false attribution of events constitutes an important problem in memory research. Peak shift is a well-characterized, controllable phenomenon in which human and animal subjects that receive reinforcement associated with one sensory stimulus later respond maximally to another stimulus in post-training stimulus generalization tests. Peak shift ordinarily develops in discrimination learning (reinforced CS+, unreinforced CS-) and has long been attributed to the interaction of an excitatory gradient centered on the CS+ and an inhibitory gradient centered on the CS-; the shift is away from the CS-. In contrast, we have obtained peak shifts during single tone frequency training, using stimulation of the cholinergic nucleus basalis (NB) to implant behavioral memory into the rat. As we also recorded cortical activity, we took the opportunity to investigate the possible existence of a neural frequency gradient that could account for behavioral peak shift. Behavioral frequency generalization gradients (FGGs, interruption of ongoing respiration) were determined twice before training while evoked potentials were recorded from the primary auditory cortex (A1), to obtain a baseline gradient of habituatory neural decrement. A post-training behavioral FGG obtained 24 h after three daily sessions of a single tone paired with NB stimulation (200 trials/day) revealed a peak shift. The peak of the FGG was at a frequency lower than the CS while the cortical inhibitory gradient was at a frequency higher than the CS frequency. Further analysis indicated that the frequency location and magnitude of the gradient could account for the behavioral peak shift. These results provide a neural basis for a systematic case of memory misattribution and may provide an animal model for the study of the neural bases of a type of false memory.

However, only Clock Delta 19 mice acquired cocaine self-administration at ZT2. A greater percentage of Clock Delta 19 mice reached acquisition criteria at ZT2 and ZT14. Clock Delta 19 mice self-administered more cocaine than WT mice. Using fixed ratio and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement dose-response paradigms, we found that cocaine is a more efficacious reinforcer in Clock Delta 19 mice than in WT mice.

An influential theory has suggested that dopamine and serotonin represent opponent systems respectively driving reward and punishment learning. Methods: To test this theory, we compared two groups of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, one unmedicated (n = 12) and one treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI; n = 13). To avoid confounding basic reinforcement learning with strategic conscious reasoning, we used a subliminal conditioning task that involves subjects learning to associate masked cues with gambling outcomes to maximize their payoff. The same task was used in a previous study to demonstrate opposite effects of dopaminergic medication on reward and punishment learning. Results: Unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder patients exhibited an instrumental learning deficit that was fully alleviated under SRI treatment. Contrary to dopaminergic medication, SRIs similarly modulated reward and punishment learning.

Initial evidence in those with chronic back pain reveals that exposure therapy reduces fear levels, disability, and pain. Despite the success of exposure in the clinic, fundamental research about its underlying mechanisms lags behind. Using a conditioning paradigm with movements as conditioned stimuli (CS) and a painful shock as unconditioned stimuli (US), we investigated the extinction of experimental fear of movement-related pain and pain-related anxiety (respectively induced by predictable and unpredictable pain). Dependent measures were self-reported fear and eyeblink startle. During acquisition, all groups received both predictable and unpredictable training. In the predictable context, one movement (CS+) was consistently followed by the shock-US, but another movement was not (CS-). In the unpredictable context, joystick movements never signaled the shock-US; shock-US were delivered during the intertrial interval (ITI). During extinction, the extinction group continued training in the predictable context but the CS+ movement was no longer reinforced; the context exposure group continued training in the unpredictable context but ITI shock-US were omitted. The control group continued training after the acquisition reinforcement scheme. Results revealed that fear ratings for the CS+ were extinguished in the extinction group but not in the control group. Interestingly, omitting the ITI shocks not only reduced ITI startle responses in the context exposure group compared with the control group, but also reduced the fear ratings and startle responses elicited by the unpredictable CS. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We test a general hypothesis that Jackson's model will predict depressive symptoms, such that poor learning is related to depression. We draw comparisons between Jackson's model and Ellis' (2004) Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy and Theory (REBT) and thereby provide a set of testable learning mechanisms potentially underlying REBT. Methods and results: Results from 80 patients diagnosed with depression completed the learning styles profiler (LSP; Jackson, 2005) and two measures of depression. Results provide support for the proposed model of learning and further evidence that low rationality is a key predictor of depression.

The present research examines how previous episodes influence sensitivity to positive and negative feedback, applying multiple hierarchical regression analysis with number of past depressive and manic episodes, residual mood symptoms, affective quality of the last episode, time in remission, medication, illness severity, and age as predictors. Methods: The study included 23 euthymic patients with BD-I, 19 remitted patients with MD, and 19 healthy persons who underwent a task which discriminates whether persons learn better from negative or positive feedback. Results: For both models, predicting sensitivity to positive [F((5,60)) = 6.50, p = 0.001, adjusted R-2 = 0.22] and negative feedback [F((5,60)) = 5.12, p = 0.001, adjusted R-2 = 0.22], the quality of the last affective episode was the only significant predictor. BD-I patients who last experienced a manic episode learned well from positive but not negative feedback, whereas BD-I patients who last experienced a depressive episode showed the opposite pattern. Conclusions: Our data identify differences in response to positive and negative consequences carrying over into the euthymic state that are qualitatively related to the polarity of the preceding episode, whereas other disease-related variables had no significant influence.

Neuroimaging is increasingly used to develop models of vPFC connections, to examine white matter (WM) integrity, and to target surgical interventions, including deep brain stimulation. We used primate (Macaca nemestrina/Macaca fascicularis) tracing studies and 3D reconstructions of WM tracts to delineate the rules vPFC projections follow to reach their targets. vPFC efferent axons travel through the uncinate fasciculus, connecting different vPFC regions and linking different functional regions. The uncinate fasciculus also is a conduit for vPFC fibers to reach other cortical bundles. Fibers in the internal capsule are organized according to destination. Thalamic fibers from each vPFC region travel dorsal to their brainstem fibers. The results show regional differences in the trajectories of fibers from different vPFC areas. Overall, the medial/lateral vPFC position dictates the route that fibers take to enter major WM tracts, as well as the position within specific tracts: axons from medial vPFC regions travel ventral to those from more lateral areas. This arrangement, coupled with dorsal/ventral organization of thalamic/brainstem fibers through the internal capsule, results in a complex mingling of thalamic and brainstem axons from different vPFC areas. Together, these data provide the foundation for dividing vPFC WM bundles into functional components and for predicting what is likely to be carried at different points through each bundle.

However, relatively little is known about the stability of reward learning over time and the effect of stress on reward responses in depressed individuals. This study aimed to evaluate sustained behaviour to maximize reward in the context of known reinforcement contingencies and to evaluate the extent to which stress influences such behaviour in clinically depressed patients (n = 43), subsyndromally depressed individuals (n = 43), and healthy controls (n = 44). A probabilistic reward learning task with contingencies known to participants was used to evaluate the change of reward response over time in both 'stress' and 'non-stress' conditions. Stress was induced by salient negative feedback during the task performance. Questionnaires capturing subjective affect were also administered to all participants after completion of the task. Response bias to the stimulus signaling greater reward decreased significantly over time in both subsyndromally and clinically depressed participants, but not in healthy controls. Healthy controls demonstrated a trend of dysfunctional reward processing under the stress condition. Moreover, in the stress condition, the deficit in sustaining behaviour to maximize reward was associated with subjective rating of pleasure in participants with either subsyndromal depression or major depression. These findings suggest that individuals with depression have difficulty sustaining behaviour during a known reinforcement schedule. Participants with anhedonic symptoms are even less likely to sustain behaviour to maximize reward under stress. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Douglas",,,Expected value and prediction error abnormalities in depression and schizophrenia,BRAIN,,,,,,,,,,,,"The dopamine system has been linked to anhedonia in depression and both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but it remains unclear how dopamine dysfunction could mechanistically relate to observed symptoms. There is considerable evidence that phasic dopamine signals encode prediction error (differences between expected and actual outcomes), with reinforcement learning theories being based on prediction error-mediated learning of associations. It has been hypothesized that abnormal encoding of neural prediction error signals could underlie anhedonia in depression and negative symptoms in schizophrenia by disrupting learning and blunting the salience of rewarding events, and contribute to psychotic symptoms by promoting aberrant perceptions and the formation of delusions. To test this, we used model based functional magnetic resonance imaging and an instrumental reward-learning task to investigate the neural correlates of prediction errors and expected-reward values in patients with depression (n = 15), patients with schizophrenia (n = 14) and healthy controls (n = 17). Both patient groups exhibited abnormalities in neural prediction errors, but the spatial pattern of abnormality differed, with the degree of abnormality correlating with syndrome severity. Specifically, reduced prediction errors in the striatum and midbrain were found in depression, with the extent of signal reduction in the bilateral caudate, nucleus accumbens and midbrain correlating with increased anhedonia severity. In schizophrenia, reduced prediction error signals were observed in the caudate, thalamus, insula and amygdala-hippocampal complex, with a trend for reduced prediction errors in the midbrain, and the degree of blunting in the encoding of prediction errors in the insula, amygdala-hippocampal complex and midbrain correlating with increased severity of psychotic symptoms. Schizophrenia was also associated with disruption in the encoding of expected-reward values in the bilateral amygdala-hippocampal complex and parahippocampal gyrus, with the degree of disruption correlating with psychotic symptom severity. Neural signal abnormalities did not correlate with negative symptom severity in schizophrenia. These findings support the suggestion that a disruption in the encoding of prediction error signals contributes to anhedonia symptoms in depression. In schizophrenia, the findings support the postulate of an abnormality in error-dependent updating of inferences and beliefs driving psychotic symptoms. Phasic dopamine abnormalities in depression and schizophrenia are suggested by our observation of prediction error abnormalities in dopamine-rich brain areas, given the evidence for dopamine encoding prediction errors. The findings are consistent with proposals that psychiatric syndromes reflect different disorders of neural valuation and incentive salience formation, which helps bridge the gap between biological and phenomenological levels of understanding.",,,,"Waiter, Gordon/AAA-1141-2020; Steele, Douglas/AAB-9889-2019; Steele, J Douglas/A-8972-2017; Kumar, Poornima/ABF-3826-2020","Steele, Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Steele, J Douglas/0000-0002-9822-8753; Waiter, Gordon/0000-0002-5313-9845; Hall, Jeremy/0000-0002-0403-3278",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8950,,,,,JUN,2011,134,,6,,,,1751,1764,,10.1093/brain/awr059,,,,,,,WOS:000291063900016,21482548,,,,,

This is the Law of Effect. As time passes since its emission, the ability for the behavior to be reinforced decreases. This is trace decay. It is upon decayed traces that subsequent BSEs operate. If the trace comes from a response, it constitutes primary reinforcement; if from perception of an extended stimulus, it is classical conditioning. This paper develops simple models of these processes. It premises exponentially decaying traces related to the richness of the environment, and conditioned reinforcement as the average of such traces over the extended stimulus, yielding an almost-hyperbolic function of duration. The models account for some data, and reinforce the theories of other analysts by providing a sufficient account of the provenance of these effects. It leads to a linear relation between sooner and later isopreference delays whose slope depends on sensitivity to reinforcement, and intercept on that and the steepness of the delay gradient.

However, much of the current debate has been fractious, and etiologies of obesity have been attributed to eating behavior (i.e. fast food consumption), personality, depression, addiction or genetics. One of the interesting new hypotheses for explaining the development of obesity involves a food addiction model, which suggests that food is not eaten as much for survival as pleasure and that hedonic overeating is relevant to both substance-related disorders and eating disorders. Accumulating evidence has shown that there are a number of shared neural and hormonal pathways as well as distinct differences in these pathways that may help researchers discover why certain individuals continue to overeat despite health and other consequences, and becomes more and more obese. Functional neuroimaging studies have further revealed that pleasant smelling, looking, and tasting food has reinforcing characteristics similar to drugs of abuse. Many of the brain changes reported for hedonic eating and obesity are also seen in various types of addictions. Most importantly, overeating and obesity may have an acquired drive similar to drug addiction with respect to motivation and incentive craving. In both cases, the desire and continued satisfaction occur after early and repeated exposure to stimuli. The acquired drive for eating food and relative weakness of the satiety signal would cause an imbalance between the drive and hunger/reward centers in the brain and their regulation. In the current paper, we first provide a summary of literature on food addition from eight different perspectives, and then we proposed a research paradigm that may allow screening of new pharmacological treatment on the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).",,,,"Life, PAM/M-9552-2013; tian, jie/M-6336-2013; Zhang, Yi/J-7496-2017; Zhang, Yi/M-9408-2013; Tian, Jie/H-1190-2011","Zhang, Yi/0000-0003-0859-9735; Zhang, Yi/0000-0001-6657-403X; Tian, Jie/0000-0003-0498-0432",,,,,,,,,,,,1381-6128,1873-4286,,,,APR,2011,17,12,,,,,1149,1157,,10.2174/138161211795656855,,,,,,,WOS:000290950800007,21492080,,,,,

Central to the learning mechanism are dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors located in the cortico-striatal synapses. However, it is still unclear how this DA-mediated synaptic plasticity is deployed and coordinated during reward-contingent behavioral changes. Here we propose a computational model of reinforcement learning that uses different thresholds of D1- and D2-mediated synaptic plasticity which are antagonized by DA-independent synaptic plasticity. A phasic increase in DA release caused by a larger-than-expected reward induces long-term potentiation (LTP) in the direct pathway, whereas a phasic decrease in DA release caused by a smaller-than-expected reward induces a cessation of long-term depression, leading to LTP in the indirect pathway. This learning mechanism can explain the robust behavioral adaptation observed in a location-reward-value-association task where the animal makes shorter latency saccades to reward locations.

Prevention strategies and treatment of this condition are therefore crucial. Success of psychosocial programs and pharmacological treatments has been frequently reported, but a better understanding of the etiology of this chronic disease is needed. For this purpose, the identification of associated factors in different populations is of great significance. It has been clearly demonstrated by twin and adoption studies and supported by animal models that both genetic and environmental components play a substancial role in alcohol dependence. Heritability estimates range from 40 to 60%, depending on the specific analyzed sample. Several coexisting genetic variants in each affected individual, rather than a single gene transmitted in a Mendelian manner, may be the rule in alcohol dependence. Similarly, many environmental factors can increase susceptibility, and because of their diversity, they do not have to be the same in every affected person. Environmental contribution may be linked to epigenetics, which refers to chemical processes that can modify gene activity without changing the sequence of DNA. In humans, the most stable epigenetic process is the union of a methyl group (one carbon atom surrounded by three hydrogen atoms) to cytosines in DNA. Other epigenetic mechanisms are modifications to nuclear proteins called histones, which alter the way DNA is packed. Moreover, non-protein coding RNAs such as microRNAs have been associated with the development of alcohol dependence. MicroRNAs could work as epigenetic intermediaries that allow ethanol to affect complex and divergent developmental mechanisms, which is added to the effect of DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and other epigenetic modifications. Most reasearch points to an association between alcohol dependence and genes related with alcohol metabolism, with neurotransmission of dopamine, GABA, serotonin, glutamate, endogenous opioids, and cannabinoids, signal transduction within the mesolimbic dopamine reward system, and stress response system, among others. During pregnancy, there are several non-genetic factors that may have an important impact on vulnerability to alcohol dependence. Given that the Central Nervous System is developing throughout the entire pregnancy and that alcohol consumed by the mother can reach the fetus through the placental barrier, the brain of a baby is always vulnerable to harm caused by alcohol exposure. Children born to alcoholic mothers may inherit genetic susceptibility variants but at the some time they may be exposed to early effects of ethanol. Heavy alcohol exposure during pregnancy has been associated with mental retardation, epilepsy, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, and later on with substance abuse, anxiety, personality, affective and psychotic disorders, as well as with engagement in antisocial behaviors and school or work problems. Furthermore, it has been shown that animals exposed to prenatal stress exhibit persisting modifications related to dopamine and glutamate transmission in limbic structures associated with dependence to alcohol and other substances. These alterations may later contribute to increase motivation to drink, to use large amounts of drugs of abuse or to relapse after periods of drug withdrawal. It was shown that after exposure to prenatal stress, male mice consumed more ethanol during alcohol reinforcement in adulthood. In addition, it has been well documented that affective disorders are associated with alcohol dependence. A recent meta-analysis including 54 studies that together involved more than 40749 individuals, confirmed that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism at the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene moderates the association between stress and depression, where the short allele is related with an increased risk for depression under stress (p = 0.00002). A strong association was detected when the stressful factor was childhood maltreatment (p = 0.00007). Childhood maltreatment, including neglect as well as physical and sexual abuse, is associated with developmental difficulties, low social competence and self-esteem, and it is an important risk factor for binge drinking in adolescence and alcohol dependence in adulthood. Childhood maltreatment may interact with factors such as variants of the monoamine oxidase-A and catechol-o-methyltransferase gene. Adolescence is a critical period for initiation of alcohol intake, experimentation, and establishment of regular drinking patterns. Substance use at this age is considered a risk factor for the development of later alcohol and other drug-related problems, as well as for externalizing disorders such as antisocial personality disorder. Alcohol use initiation is affected by environmental factors such as ethanol availability, parental attitudes, and peer pressure. It has been reported that heavy drinking during adolescence can have a negative impact on brain development. Moreover, dopaminergic and GABAergic systems undergo important changes during adolescence, and they can be affected by alcohol intake. Dopamine is implicated in the rewarding effects of ethanol, and GABA in its sedating effects and development of tolerance. The way an adult copes with environmental challenges is notably influenced by early life experiences and by the familial environment he or she had axon infant, which affects neurodevelopmental behavior. While environmental factors tend to have a crucial role in drinking habits in adolescence, adultood may be characterized by a weaker effect of environment and a higher effect of genetic components. It is probable that a complex set of gene-environment interactions determine the risk to alcohol dependence. Environmental factors that may affect this vulnerability appear at different stages from pregnancy to adulthood. These interactions are mediated by DNA methylation, histone modifications, protein complexes and nonprotein-coding RNAs such as microRNAs.",,,,"DIAZ-ANZALDUA, ADRIANA/R-7240-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,0185-3325,,,,,MAR-APR,2011,34,2,,,,,157,166,,,,,,,,,WOS:000291570200009,,,,,,

In accordance with that, OCD patients show alterations in learning and flexible adaptation to changing task requirements. The purpose of this study was to examine feedback-based learning and to investigate whether learning from positive and negative feedback is differentially altered in OCD. Methods: In this study, 18 OCD patients and 18 healthy comparison subjects conducted a probabilistic selection task. The task consisted of an acquisition and a test phase and allowed disentangling the extent of learning based on positive and negative feedback. Results: Groups did not differ during probabilistic feedback learning in the acquisition phase. In the test phase, OCD patients showed a negative learning bias in contrast to comparison subjects who showed a positive learning bias. Patients were better at avoiding stimuli that were initially associated with negative outcomes than at approaching stimuli that were associated with positive feedbacks. This interaction was also found for reaction times in that patients were faster in avoiding negative and slower in approaching positive stimuli. Conclusion: Enhanced avoidance learning was found in OCD patients that points to exaggerated anticipation and avoidance of aversive outcomes. Further studies are required to investigate whether neurobiological mechanisms, such as dopaminergic signaling or outcome processing, in the orbitofrontal cortex relate to enhanced negative learning in OCD.

In a double blind placebo (PLA)-controlled crossover design, 17 healthy volunteers (six males, 11 females) aged between 18 and 25 were tested after TPD and PLA. Working memory was assessed using a Sternberg memory scanning task (SMS) and episodic memory using the Visual Verbal Learning Test (VVLT). Simultaneously, event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured. The tyrosine and phenylalanine ratio was significantly reduced after TPD and increased after PLA. Working memory performance was not affected by TPD. However, ERP measures were affected by the treatment, indicating that TPD impaired stimulus processing during working memory performance. Episodic memory was not impaired after TPD. Again, alterations in ERP measures suggested adverse effects of TPD on memory- related processing.

Faster avoidance acquisition may reflect an inherent ability to acquire cue-outcome associations, response-outcome associations or both. To evaluate cue-outcome learning, acquisition of classically conditioned eyeblink response was compared in SD and WKY rats using a delay-type paradigm (500-ms conditioned stimulus (CS) coterminating with a 10-ms unconditional stimulus (US)). WKY rats demonstrated enhanced classical conditioning, with both faster acquisition and greater asymptotic performance in delay-type training than SD rats. To evaluate response-outcome learning, separate SD and WIN rats were given control over US delivery through imposition of an omission contingency into delay-type training (emitting a conditioned response (CR) prevented delivery of the US). The schedule of US delivery derived by these rats became the training regimen for a separate group of SD and WKY rats, yoked within strain. In SD rats, no differences in acquisition were detected between those given control over US delivery and those trained with the same partial reinforcement schedule. Acquisition rates of those WKY rats with control exceeded those trained with a yoked-schedule of US presentation. Collectively, WKY rats exhibit enhanced classical conditioning and sensitivity to schedules of reinforcement compared to outbred SD rats. Anxiety vulnerability, in particular inhibited temperament, may be traced to active processes in the prediction and control of aversive events.

B.",,,Larger error signals in major depression are associated with better avoidance learning,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is particularly reactive to signals of error, punishment, and conflict in the service of behavioral adaptation and it is consistently implicated in the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). This association makes conceptual sense, given that MDD has been associated with hyper-reactivity in neural systems associated with punishment processing. Yet in practice, depression-related variance in measures of mPFC functioning often fails to relate to performance. For example, neuroelectric reflections of mediofrontal error signals are often found to be larger in MDD, but a deficit in post-error performance suggests that these error signals are not being used to rapidly adapt behavior. Thus, it remains unknown if depression-related variance in error signals reflects a meaningful alteration in the use of error or punishment information. However, larger mediofrontal error signals have also been related to another behavioral tendency: increased accuracy in avoidance learning. The integrity of this error-avoidance system remains untested in MDD. In this study, EEG was recorded as 21 symptomatic, drug-free participants with current or past MDD and 24 control participants performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task. Depressed participants had larger mid-frontal EEG responses to error feedback than controls. The direct relationship between error signal amplitudes and avoidance learning accuracy was replicated. Crucially, this relationship was stronger in depressed participants for high conflict lose-lose situations, demonstrating a selective alteration of avoidance learning. This investigation provided evidence that larger error signal amplitudes in depression are associated with increased avoidance learning, identifying a candidate mechanistic model for hypersensitivity to negative outcomes in depression.",,,,"Cavanagh, James F/I-5222-2015","Cavanagh, James/0000-0003-2428-3562",,,,,,,,,,,,1664-1078,,,,,,2011,2,,,,,,,,331,10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00331,,,,,,,WOS:000208863800146,22084638,,,,,

Patients demonstrate a triad of motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. A transgenic rat model (tgHD rats) carrying 51 CAG repeats demonstrate progressive striatal degeneration and polyglutamine aggregates in limbic structures. In this model, emotional function has only been investigated through anxiety studies. Our aim was to extend knowledge on emotional and motivational function in symptomatic tgHD rats. We subjected tgHD and wild-type rats to behavioral protocols testing motor, emotional, and motivational abilities. From 11 to 15 months of age, animals were tested in emotional perception of sucrose using taste reactivity, acquisition, extinction, and re-acquisition of discriminative Pavlovian fear conditioning as well as reactivity to changes in reinforcement values in a runway Pavlovian approach task. Motor tests detected the symptomatic status of tgHD animals from 11 months of age. In comparison to wild types, transgenic animals exhibited emotional blunting of hedonic perception for intermediate sucrose concentration. Moreover, we found emotional alterations with better learning and re-acquisition of discriminative fear conditioning due to a higher level of conditioned fear to aversive stimuli, and hyper-reactivity to a negative hedonic shift in reinforcement value interpreted in term of greater frustration. Neuropathological assessment in the same animals showed a selective shrinkage of the central nucleus of the amygdala. Our results showing emotional blunting and hypersensitivity to negative emotional situations in symptomatic tgHD animals extend the face validity of this model regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms as seen in manifest HD patients, and suggest that some of these symptoms may be related to amygdala dysfunction.

In contrast, the stimulation of histaminergic neurotransmission can ameliorate learning and memory impairments that are associated with various experimental deficit models and pathological conditions. Clinical investigations with patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease demonstrate pathological alterations in the brain's histaminergic system, which, in some cases are correlated with the severity of cognitive deficits.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as long-term depression (LTD) are the major cellular models which could underlie learning and memory formation. LTP and LTD consist of at least two phases, an early protein synthesis-independent transient stage (<4 h; E-LTP, E-LTD) as well as a prolonged phase (>4 h; L-LTP, L-LTD) requiring the synthesis of new proteins. It is known that during E-LTP the further induction of longer lasting LTP is precluded. However, if E-LTP is transformed into L-LTP, the same synapses now allow the induction of LTP again. We reproduced the LTP-results first and then investigated whether hippocampal LTP or LTD also prevents the establishment of subsequent LTD-induction in the same synaptic input. We show that the prior induction of LTP or LTD does not prevent a short-term depression (STD) but occludes LTD in apical dendrites of CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices in vitro during the early phase of LIP or LTD. However, LTD can again be induced in addition to STD after the establishment of L-LTP or L-LTD, that is about 4 h after the induction of the first event in the same synaptic input. We suggest that the neuronal input preserves the capacity for STD immediately after an initial potentiation or depression, but for the onset of additional longer lasting LTD in the same synaptic input, the establishment of the late plasticity form of the preceding event is critical.

Growth of behavioral avoidance in people is a significant predictor of symptom severity in anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Using an animal model, our lab is examining how the process of learning avoidant behavior may lead certain individuals to develop anxiety. Here we examined whether the known vulnerabilities of female sex and behaviorally inhibited temperament have individual or additive effects upon the acquisition of an active-avoidance response. A discrete trial lever-press escape-avoidance protocol was used to examine the acquisition of behavioral avoidance in male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and behaviorally inhibited inbred Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Overall, WKY rats of both sexes were indistinguishable in their behavior during the acquisition of an active-avoidance response, exhibiting quicker acquisition of reinforced responses both between and within session compared to SD rats. Further WKY rats emitted more non-reinforced responses than SD rats. Sex differences were evident in SD rats in both the acquisition of the reinforced response and the emission of non-reinforced responses, with SD females acquiring the response quicker and emitting more non-reinforced responses following lever presses that led to an escape from shock. As vulnerability factors, behavioral inhibition and female sex were each associated with more prevalent reinforced and non-reinforced avoidant behavior, but an additive effect of these 2 factors was not observed. These data illustrate the importance of genetics (both strain and sex) in the assessment and modeling of anxiety vulnerability through the acquisition of active-avoidance responses and the persistence of emitting those responses in periods of non-reinforcement.

Importantly, these wider generalization curves persist even if outcomes for all tones are made identical, indicating that the learning induced a perceptual change, and not merely a decision bias. Moreover, it persists after taking into account loss-aversion, suggesting it is a result of valence per se, and not intensity that reflects overweighting of the aversive stimuli.

Suicide may be viewed as an outcome of an altered decision process. The authors hypothesized that impairment in reward/punishment-based learning, a component of affective decision making, is associated with attempted suicide in late-life depression. They expected that suicide attempters would discount past reward/punishment history, focusing excessively on the most recent rewards and punishments. The authors further hypothesized that this impairment could be dissociated from executive abilities, such as forward planning. Method: The authors assessed reward/punishment- based learning using the probabilistic reversal learning task in 65 individuals age 60 and older: suicide attempters, suicide ideators, nonsuicidal depressed elderly, and nondepressed comparison subjects. The authors used a reinforcement learning computational model to decompose reward/punishment processing over time. The Stockings of Cambridge test served as a control measure of executive function. Results: Suicide attempters but not suicide ideators showed impaired probabilistic reversal learning compared to both nonsuicidal depressed elderly and nondepressed comparison subjects, after controlling for effects of education, global cognitive function, and substance use. Model- based analyses revealed that suicide attempters discounted previous history to a higher degree relative to comparison subjects, basing their choice largely on reward/ punishment received on the last trial. Groups did not differ in their performance on the Stockings of Cambridge test. Conclusions: Older suicide attempters display impaired reward/punishmentbased learning. The authors propose a hypothesis that older suicide attempters make overly present-focused decisions, ignoring past experiences.

Several song and auditory nuclei are innervated by midbrain dopaminergic fibers and contain neurons with various dopamine receptors. During sexually motivated singing, activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and dopamine release in the striatal Area X, involved in song learning and maintenance, are higher. In this review we provide an overview of the dopaminergic system and neurotransmission in songbirds and the outline of possible involvement of dopamine in control of song learning, production, and maintenance. Based on both behavioral and computational biology data, we describe several models of song learning and the proposed role of dopamine in them. Special attention is given to possible role of dopamine in incentive salience (wanting) and reward prediction error signaling during song learning and maintenance, as well as the role of dopamine-mediated synaptic plasticity in reward processing. Finally, the role of dopamine in determination of personality traits in relation to birdsong is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigated the role of cognitive and related functions in selectively bred helpless (cLH, n = 10), non-helpless (cNLH, n = 12) and wild type (WT, n = 8) Sprague Dawley rats. The animals were exposed to an open field for 10 min on each of two test days. On the third day, an object exploration paradigm was carried out. The animals were later tested for helplessness. Both cLH and cNLH rats were more active than WTs on the first day in the open field. Over trials, cNLH and WT rats lowered their activity less than cLH rats. This resistance-to-habituation co-varied with a resistance to develop helplessness. In cLH rats, higher 'anxiety' or less time spent in the center of the open field co-varied with severe helplessness. In WTs, a greater reactivity to novel objects and to a spatially relocated object predicted lower levels of helplessness. In cLH rats (n = 4-5 per group), chronic treatment with a high dose of the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor deprenyl (10 mg/kg; i.p.), an anti-Parkinson, noo-tropic and antidepressant drug, attenuated helplessness. Remarkably, helplessness reversal required the experience of repeated test trials, reminiscent of a learning process. Chronic deprenyl (10 mg/kg; i.p.) did not alter locomotion/exploration or 'anxiety' in the open field. In conclusion, helplessness may be related to altered mechanisms of reinforcement learning and working memory, and to abnormalities in MAO-A and/or MAO-B functioning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This chapter focuses on norepinephrine and dopamine, catecholamines which have neurotransmitter functions in the mammalian central nervous system. Significant events in the development of our understanding of catecholamines and a timeline are presented. Central norepinephrine is thought to play a role in the regulation of learning and memory, reinforcement, mood, arousal and sleep. Drugs used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric illnesses, such as depression and aggressive or disruptive behavior, act by interacting with adrenergic receptors in the specific region of the brain. Two types of adrenoreceptors (alpha-adrenoceptors and beta-adrenoceptors) with numerous subtypes have been found in brain. A deficiency in norepinephrine or reduction in its receptor functional activity may be associated with depression. There are three dopaminergic pathways and two families of dopamine receptors (D1-like and D2-like) in the brain that influence motor function, behavior, reward and drug dependence, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and prolactin release. A depletion of dopamine exists in the substantia nigra and striatum in Parkinson disease. One leading model of schizophrenia suggests that schizophrenia is associated with an increase in the functional activity of dopamine in the limbic system.

Measures of Extraversion (E) and Neuroticism (N) and Trait Anxiety were taken. Participants completed six blocks of a procedural learning task, under either punishment or control (no reinforcement) in one of two training conditions: (a) spaced training (four blocks of the task in the first session followed by retest on one block in two subsequent sessions, 24 h and 5 days later); or (b) massed training (six blocks of the task in a single session). Results showed that, under punishment, high trait anxiety led to enhanced learning in both training conditions; however, this increase was not predicted by Eysenck's arousal-based personality theory, but rather high anxiety facilitated learning in a manner consistent with RST predictions. There was no effect of spaced vs. mass training: Procedural learning increased over the course of the testing sessions under both conditions. Results failed to support Eysenck's predictions for reminiscence as a function of personality but suggested that learning was enhanced under punishment in line with RST's predictions for high anxiety.

,,J,"Radulovic, J; Tronson, NC",,,,"Radulovic, Jelena; Tronson, Natalie C.",,,Molecular Specificity of Multiple Hippocampal Processes Governing Fear Extinction,REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Over many years, fear extinction has been conceptualized as one dominant process, new inhibitory learning, which serves to dampen previously acquired fear. Here we present an alternative view, that brain region-specific processing of representations, expectations and emotional attributes of the fear-provoking event, recruits unique mechanisms that interdependently contribute to the conditioning and extinction of fear. The co-occurrence of these mechanisms within the fear circuit can thus be tracked and differentiated at a molecular and cellular level. Among others, the transcriptional regulators cFos, cAMP-dependent response element binding protein (CREB), Zif268, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) stand out as hippocampal nuclear markers signaling novelty, arousal, retrieval, and prediction error, respectively. Consistent with evidence from human studies, these findings indicate that, beyond inhibitory learning, fear extinction requires modification of the emotional attributes and expectations that define the threatening context. Given the likely dysregulation of one or more of these processes in anxiety disorders, a key research challenge for the future is the identification and enhancement of individual extinction mechanisms to target the specific components of fear. Environmental stimuli lacking affective properties (conditioned stimuli, CS) rapidly become threatening if presented with stressful events (unconditioned stimuli, US). Consequently, based on a CS-US association, the presentation of the CS triggers species-specific fear responses until the US consistently stops occurring. At that point, new learning takes place and the fear response declines, a phenomenon termed extinction. The view that extinction occurs because a new, inhibitory CS-noUS association gains control over behavior /106/, has remained dominant in the field (reviewed by /20,33,35,100/). The implications of impaired fear regulation in the development of anxiety disorders have stimulate-d intense research in this area. Rodent studies identified the circuits involved in the conditioning and extinction of fear of salient cues /99,98,85,93,150/, generating data that were confirmed in humans with brain imaging approaches /114,130/. Nevertheless, research with experimental animals has not fully taken advantage of human data in order to better interpret extinction mechanisms in the framework of learning, expectation and emotion governing fear-motivated behavior. The present article aims to summarize recent molecular evidence on fear extinction, focusing on hippocampal mechanisms and experimental models of contextual fear, and compare the results with other relevant fear paradigms and human imaging studies. Instead of conceptualizing extinction learning as one process, such as CS-noUS association or inhibitory learning /19,26,96/, we propose that fear extinction reflects the behavioral output of several region-specific learning processes that modify different components of the conditioning memory. The significance of these findings is discussed in the framework of fear regulation and anxiety disorders.",,,,,"Radulovic, Jelena/0000-0002-0268-2426; Tronson, Natalie/0000-0001-5676-1579",,,,,,,,,,,,0334-1763,1607-8470,,,,,2010,21,1,,,,,1,17,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277168300001,20458884,,,,,
,,J,"Mares, MF; Torres, LB",,,,"Flores Mares, Marlene; Barragan Torres, Lydia",,,Maintenance of training on refusal skills in cronic users of alcohol and drugs: a case study,SALUD MENTAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"In Mexico, alcohol and drug consumption has been a social problem for many years. Epidemiological studies show that moderate-to-high alcohol consumption has persisted in recent years, whereas in the case of illegal drugs consumption has become more widespread in both men and women. In fact, there is a tendency for consumption rates to level out between men and women, especially regarding legal drugs. Although most users are moderate consumers, between 5-10% are chronic consumers. It is necessary for these people to have access to a range of treatments that incorporate a system of examination and systematization. Consequently, in Mexico it is necessary to create new programs with a methodological structure that makes it possible to assess whether they assist in curtailing this social problem. One program that has proven to be effective is the Daily Satisfaction Program (DSP), which is based on the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA). CRA is notable as one of the most successful programs in helping chronic users of legal or illegal drugs in the United States to give up substance abuse. In Mexico, it was necessary to modify some of the elements of DSP in order to adapt it to our culture, but it has encouraged a significant reduction in consumption patterns among participating users. This is an intensive program that includes several components, due to the serious nature of the problem to be tackled. However, it is necessary to carry out a systematized assessment of each of these components that foster in the user not only a reduction in consumption but also an increase in the satisfaction found in day-to-day activities. In Mexican culture, there are strong social pressures that affect consumption. Consequently the refuse-to-consume component is one of the most important, as it provides the user with the necessary strategies to be able to decline in a situation with peer pressure and in those moments when impulsive thoughts occur that might trigger the consumption response in the subject. The refuse-to-consume skills that were assessed in users were: body language, assertive refusal, suggesting alternatives, changing the subject of conversation, offering an explanation, suspending interaction, confronting the offerer, and changing impulsive thoughts by using cognitivist restructuring. Some investigators have detected a correlation between high consumption levels and a low degree of self-efficacy in refusing consumption. According to this theory, low self-efficacy in refusing Articulo original consumption is the most accurate indicator of consumption behavior and makes it possible to discriminate between different types of user. High self-efficacy in refusing consumption is associated with less frequent episodes of consumption. With regard to motivation, these authors suggest that better self-efficacy in refusing consumption when offered the substance or in response to impulsive thoughts ha; an influence on the decision to consume or not to consume. In order to achieve a higher degree of self-efficacy in refuse-to-consume skills, it is necessary to control certain body responses that denote the desire or wish to consume. Some of these responses are: avoidance of eye contact, trembling, stuttering, blushing, sweating, palpitations, etc. The physiological responses associated with consumption are still displayed after the user has been through a period of non-consumption. They may be triggered by words associated with consumption or by watching videos of people who are consuming. Responses of this kind may be explained from a classical conditioning viewpoint, whereby a given stimulus provokes a given type of response. To explain what elicits, maintains, and increases the consumption of alcoholic drinks, three models of conditioning have been posited: the conditioned withdrawal model, the compensatory response model, and the conditioned motivational model. These models are based on an analysis of alcohol consumption situations with the aim of identifying the related variables. The model that most clearly explains alcohol consumption as a conditioned response is conditioned withdrawal. According to this model, in the case of people who have a history of alcohol dependence the stimuli associated with alcohol consumption (visual, olfactory, and auditory) provoke physiological responses such as salivation, trembling hands, or sweating. Alcohol consumption reduces these responses, which the subject is averse to. Users learn that, when they are offered a drink or drugs (the stimulus), they should accept it (the response). The aim of refuse-to-consume skills is to teach them to change their response to the stimulus, in other words, to teach users the necessary skills so that they learn to say no. When people are in the process of changing their consumption patterns by learning refusal skills and they experience high-risk situations, ills very probable that on the first few occasions they will exhibit a behavior that shows they are feeling insecure or anxious, such as avoiding eye contact with the person offering them the substance, stuttering, mumbling, not speaking with a decisive tone of voice, sweating, or having shaky hands. These responses make the offerer doubt whether the individual wishes to give up consuming, so he or she is more likely to insist and encourage a relapse in the user. Consequently, it is necessary to teach users how to react to these offers by relaxing and behaving assertively. This can be achieved by applying refuse-to-consume skills. Relaxation produces emotional effects that are the exact opposite of anxiety and which may be used therapeutically in everyday situations. Thus, it is less likely that the person offering the substance will follow up a refusal by repeating the offer, and the user may then take control of the situation and feel more secure. Peer pressure constitutes a high-risk factor that causes many users to relapse. It consists of direct or indirect pressure from other individuals or social groups who exert an influence on the user. In the case of direct pressure, the contact is personal, the offer involves verbal interaction, and the offerer is insistent that the user should consume the substance. In the case of indirect peer pressure, the user responds by watching other people use the substance in question. Often peers do not understand that the user has made a decision to quit and are insistent that he or she should continue to consume; the user also frequently feels that justification should be provided when refusing an offer. In reality, such an explanation is not necessary in most cases. It is frequently the case that when the user is with family members or close friends, they may question the refusal. For this reason, it is important for the user to preempt this reaction by asking friends and family members for support as a first step in the recovery process. The user must also interpret events, impulses, and emotions rationally, bearing in mind the negative consequences of consuming and the benefits of being sober or drug-free. Consequently, the user needs to learn to say no to him- or herself whenever temptation arises in the form of thoughts or desires. The user must confront them and change them into positive thoughts that favor his or her wellbeing and are unrelated to consumption. The objective of this study was to assess the degree of aptitude attained in refuse-to-consume skills by four chronic drug users in the Daily Satisfaction Program (DSP). Each user performed an evaluation of the high-risk situations in which consumption might occur as a result of peer pressure, and carried out a behavioral test in which the skills learnt were put to use. Subsequently, the users identified their impulsive thoughts and carried out an exercise in which the therapist repeated out loud the impulsive thoughts and the user replaced them with positive thoughts oriented toward reversing the decision to consume. These exercises were recorded and evaluated by two DSP therapists. Results indicate a high level of skill in refusing consumption in the face of external and internal pressure. Users also put these skills into practice in real-life situations, thereby reducing their episodes of consumption or maintaining abstinence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0185-3325,,,,,JAN-FEB,2010,33,1,,,,,47,55,,,,,,,,,WOS:000276218600006,,,,,,

In addition to its utility in determining whether the effects of drugs are mediated though 3 CB, receptor mechanism of action, these antagonists are useful in providing insight into the physiological function of the endogeneous cannabinoid system. Several groups have reported that CB1 receptor antagonists enhance memory duration in I variety of spatial and operant paradigms, but not in all paradigms. Conversely, disruption of CB1 receptor signaling also impairs extinction learning in which the animal actively suppresses a learned response when reinforcement has been withheld. These extinction deficits occur in aversively motivated tasks, such as in fear conditioning or escape behavior in the Morris water maze task, but not in appetitively motivated tasks. Similarly, in electrophysiological models, CB1 receptor antagonists elicit a variety of effects, including enhancement of long-term potentiation (LTP), while disrupting long-term depression (LTD) and interfering with transient forms of plasticity, including depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) and depolarization-induced Suppression of excitation (DSE). The collective results of the in vivo and in vitro studies employing CB1 receptor antagonists, demonstrate that these receptors play integral roles in different components of cognitive processing. Functionally, pharmacological blockade of CB1 receptors may strengthen memory duration, hut interferes with extinction of learned behaviors that are associated with traumatic or aversive memories.

Accurate treatment of microcircuit pathways is especially critical for creating models that correctly predict the outcomes of candidate neurological therapies. Recent models are trying to specify how cortical circuits that enable planning and Voluntary actions interact with adaptive subcortical microcircuits in the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are strongly implicated in reinforcement learning, and in all behavior and cognition over which the frontal lobes exert flexible control. The persisting role of the basal ganglia shows that ancient vertebrate designs for motivated action selection proved adaptable enough to support many modern behavioral innovations, including fluent generation of language and speech. This paper summarizes how recent models have incorporated realistic representations of microcircuit features, and have begun to trace their computational implications. Also summarized are recent empirical discoveries that provide guidance regarding how to formulate the rules for synaptic modification that govern learning in cortico-striatal pathways. Such efforts are contributing to an emerging synthesis based on an interlocking set of computational hypotheses regarding cortical interactions with basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei.

Ethanol reinforcement has been successfully studied through Pavlovian and operant conditioning in adult rats and mice genetically selected for their ready acceptance of ethanol. Another model for studying ethanol reinforcement is the immature (preweanling) rat, which consumes ethanol and exhibits the capacity to process tactile, odor and taste cues and transfer information between different sensorial modalities. This review describes the motivational effects of ethanol in preweanling, heterogeneous non-selected rats. Preweanlings exhibit ethanol-mediated conditioned taste avoidance and conditioned place aversion. Ethanol's appetitive effects, however, are evident when using first- and second-order conditioning and operant procedures. Ethanol also devalues the motivational representation of aversive stimuli, suggesting early negative reinforcement.

This model proposes that the body and its surrounding environment are represented in the striatum in a fragmented and repeated way, like a mosaic consisting of the fragmented images of broken mirrors. Each fragment forms a functional unit representing articulated parts of the body with motion properties, objects of the environment which the subject can approach or manipulate, and locations the subject can move to. These units integrate the sensory properties and movements related to them. The repeated and widespread distribution of such units amplifies the combinatorial power of the associations among them. These associations depend on the phasic release of dopamine in the striatum triggered by the saliency of stimuli and will be reinforced by the rewarding consequences of the actions related to them. Dopamine permits synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal synapses. The striatal units encoding the same stimulus/action send convergent projections to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) that stimulate or hold the action through a thalamus-frontal cortex pathway. According to this model, this is how the basal ganglia select actions based on environmental stimuli and store adaptive associations as nondeclarative memories such as motor skills, habits, and memories formed by Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning.

However, the key signals triggering and regulating the activity of Erk are not known. By varying the degree of expected and delivered aversive reinforcement, we demonstrate that Erk specifically responds to prediction errors of contextual aversive events. An increase of somatonuclear phospho-Erk (pErk) within principal CA1 neurons was observed only when the expectation of contextual foot shock was violated, but not when the context was consistently nonreinforced or reinforced by foot shock. The rate of error detection, Erk signaling, and fear extinction markedly depended on shock expectancy and the aversive valence of the context, as revealed by comparison of groups trained with single, continuous, or partial reinforcement.

At the time predicted by the second (and third) previous intervals, there were minor trends (and no change) in the same direction. In summary, at the times predicted, SHR respond more than control rats. The effect size is insufficient to account for all the differences from control rats, such as their nearly threefold greater operant responding. At the times when SHR increase responding, WKY suppress it. This demonstrates similar learning to the SHR but the opposite response, probably due to anxiety about the bang accompanying reinforcer delivery: WKY are known to have a very negative response to stress. Interval schedules with randomised interval lengths have considerable potential for assessing multiple causes of behaviour, particularly those acting over short timecourses. Alterations in learning rate are nota sufficient explanation for either SHR or ADHD difference from controls. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Extant learning-based accounts of ADHD are unable to account for the temporary amelioration effect. One possible mechanism is a drive for novelty. Computational simulations have previously shown that such a drive can result from a dopamine appetite. Empirical demonstration of such a process requires, as a first step, the development of standard criteria for identifying drive-based, versus learning-based, changes in behaviour. Using a variable-interval reinforcement schedule, we looked over a range of timescales for behavioural changes showing putative characteristics of drives, namely: low information content, unidirectionality, saturability, spontaneous reversibility in less than a day, and cycle stability. SHR lacks normal down-regulation of responding when the schedule becomes sparser. SHR appears to be re-learning the schedule length during the days of each calendar week. SHR hyperactivity is specific to the operant and develops gradually over the first five minutes of each session. Empirical within-session results were replicated by a simple simulation containing two interacting reward systems, one for water and the other for stimulation (including novelty), To summarise, enhanced sensation-seeking (or a subtype of it, novelty-seeldng) provides the best available account of changes in SHR activity within sessions, though not of changes over longer timecourses. Sensation-seeking appears to be associated with low anxiety in the SHR. SHR propensity to display multiple influences on their behaviour makes them ideal for further pharmacological, genetic, and behavioural investigation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

,,J,"Smillie, LD",,,,"Smillie, Luke D.",,,What is reinforcement sensitivity? Neuroscience paradigms for approach-avoidance process theories of personality,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reinforcement sensitivity is a concept proposed by Gray (1973) to describe the biological antecedents of personality, and has become the common mechanism among a family of personality theories concerning approach and avoidance processes. These theories suggest that 2-3 biobehavioural systems mediate the effects of reward and punishment on emotion and motivation, and that individual differences in the functioning of these systems manifest as personality identifying paradigms for operationalising reinforcement sensitivity is therefore critical for testing and developing these theories, and evaluating their footprint in personality space. In this paper I suggest that, while traditional self-report paradigms in personality psychology may be less-than-ideal for this purpose, neuroscience paradigms may offer operations of reinforcement sensitivity at multiple levels of approach and avoidance processes. After brief reflection on the use of such methods in animal models-which first spawned the concept of reinforcement sensitivity-recent developments in four domains of neuroscience are reviewed. These are psychogenomics, psychopharmacology, neuroimaging and category-learning. By exploring these paradigms as potential operations of reinforcement sensitivity we may enrich our understanding of the putative biobehavioural bases of personality.

Bipolar disorder subjects often show excessive goal-directed and pleasure-seeking behavior during manic episodes and reduced hedonic capacity during depressive episodes, indicating that BPD might involve altered reward processing. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that BPD is characterized by impairments in adjusting behavior as a function of prior reinforcement history, particularly in the presence of residual anhedonic symptoms. Methods: Eighteen medicated BPD subjects and 25 demographically matched comparison subjects performed a probabilistic reward task. To identify putative dysfunctions in reward processing irrespective of mood state, primary analyses focused on euthymic BPD subjects (n = 13). With signal-detection methodologies, response bias toward a more frequently rewarded stimulus was used to objectively assess the participants' propensity to modulate behavior as a function of reinforcement history. Results: Relative to comparison subjects, euthymic BPD subjects showed a reduced and delayed acquisition of response bias toward the more frequently rewarded stimulus, which was partially due to increased sensitivity to single rewards of the disadvantageous stimulus. Analyses considering the entire BPD sample revealed that reduced reward learning correlated with self-reported anhedonic symptoms, even after adjusting for residual manic and anxious symptoms and general distress. Conclusions: The present study provides preliminary evidence indicating that BPD, even during euthymic states, is characterized by dysfunctional reward learning in situations requiring integration of reinforcement information over time and thus offers initial insights about the potential source of dysfunctional reward processing in this disorder.",,,,"Iosifescu, Dan/L-3305-2019; Pizzagalli, Diego A./Z-1595-2019","Iosifescu, Dan/0000-0002-2512-2835; Ostacher, Michael/0000-0003-0353-7535",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3223,1873-2402,,,,JUL 15,2008,64,2,,,,,162,168,,10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.12.001,,,,,,,WOS:000257187700011,18242583,,,,,

We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations.

We studied the impact of holeboard training on UP in the rat CAI hippocampal region. In 7-week-old Wistar rats a recording electrode was chronically implanted into the hippocarnpal pyramidal cell layer of the CAI of the right hemisphere and a stimulation electrode into the contralateral CA3 region. Two groups of animals received a spatial holeboard training of 10 or 15 trials over 2 days on a fixed pattern of baited holes. The last trial was performed 15 min after a primed burst stimulation of the contralateral CA3, which resulted in LTP in the ipsilateral CAI. A pseudo-trained group that received a 10 trial training with changing patterns of baited holes after each trial and a group that remained in the recording chambers during the experiments served as controls. Experimental rats significantly improved their spatial performance with increasing numbers of trials, indicated by decreasing times to pick up all food pellets and by decreasing numbers of reference memory errors. A learning-related impairment of CAI-LTP measured in both the population-spike amplitude as well as the fEPSP could be noted. These results show that specific (pattern-training), but not unspecific (pseudo-training) spatial information processing prior to electrical stimulation can severely affect LTP in hippocampal area CAI.

Reactivation of recent salient cue states is generated and maintained as a type of salience gated recurrently active working memory, while lower salience distractors are ignored. Cue reactivation during the action selection period allows the cue to select an action while its reactivation at the reward period allows the reinforcement of the action selected by the reactivated state, which is necessarily the action which led to the reward being found. A down-gating of the external input during the reactivation and maintenance prevents interference. A double winner-take-all system which selects only one cue and only one action allows the targeting of the cue-action allocation to be modified. This targeting works both to reinforce a correct cue-action allocation and to punish the allocation when cue-action allocations change. Here we suggest a firing rate neural network implementation of this system based on the basal ganglia anatomy with input from a cortical association layer where reactivations are generated by signals from the thalamus. Striatum medium spiny neurons represent actions. Auto-catalytic feedback from a dopamine reward signal modulates three-way Hebbian long term potentiation and depression at the cortical-striatal synapses which represent the cue-action associations. The model is illustrated by the numerical simulations of a simple example - that of associating a cue signal to a correct action to obtain reward after a delay period, typical of primate cue reward tasks. Through learning. the model shows a transition from an exploratory phase where actions are generated randomly, to a stable directed phase where the animal always chooses the Correct action for each experienced state. When cue-action allocations change, we show that this is noticed by the model, the incorrect cue-action allocations are punished and the correct ones discovered.

There is considerable evidence for the involvement of serotonin in both the learning of these predictions and the inhibitory consequences that ensue, although less for a causal relationship between the two. In the context of a highly simplified model of chains of affectively charged thoughts, we interpret the combined effects of serotonin in terms of pruning a tree of possible decisions, (i.e., eliminating those choices that have low or negative expected outcomes). We show how a drop in behavioral inhibition, putatively resulting from an experimentally or psychiatrically influenced drop in serotonin, could result in unexpectedly large negative prediction errors and a significant aversive shift in reinforcement statistics. We suggest an interpretation of this finding that helps dissolve the apparent contradiction between the fact that inhibition of serotonin reuptake is the first-line treatment of depression, although serotonin itself is most strongly linked with aversive rather than appetitive outcomes and predictions.",,,,,"Dayan, Peter/0000-0003-3476-1839; Huys, Quentin/0000-0002-8999-574X",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,FEB,2008,4,2,,,,,,,e4,10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040004,,,,,,,WOS:000255407800031,18248087,,,,,

However, studies examining the neuropathology of depressive-like behavior induced in the aged rodent are sparse. Extinction of learned behavior induces behavioral 'despair', and is held to provide a conceptual and empirical model of human depression resulting from the withdrawal of reinforcement. We tested whether the neuro-endocrinological and chemical concomitants of susceptibility to extinction-induced despair in aged animals differed from adult ones. Following the withholding of reinforcement (extinction of escape from a water maze), a number of aged and adult rats are prone to develop depressive-like behavior, i.e. immobility. Analysis of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis markers revealed an increase in the mineralocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor (MR/GR) mRNA ratio in the CA1 region of the hippo campus in aged and adult despair animals; however, in dependence on age, divergent changes contributed to the enhanced ratio. While aged despair rats had less GR mRNA, adult despair rats had more MR mRNA. Furthermore, age- and despair-related interactions with hippocampal and cortical steroid receptor co-activators and neurotransmitter contents in diverse brain areas were found. For instance, adult despair rats had an increased, and aged despair rats a decreased, DOPAC/dopamine turnover compared to the respective non-despair group. These results show that neurobiological underpinnings of depression in the aged differ from those of adults, and underline the importance of investigating age-related alterations in HPA axis dynamics in conjunction with neurotransmitter systems to advance our knowledge about neuronal mechanisms of late-life and/or late-onset depression.

Healthy participants (N = 42) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a CS-only, contingent CS-US pairings, or unpaired/non-contingent CS and US presentations. Electrodermal and self-report (e.g., distress, fear) served as indices of conditioned emotional responding. Results showed greater magnitude electrodermal and evaluative fear conditioning in the paired relative to the CS-only condition. The explicitly impaired condition showed even greater electrodermal and evaluative responding during acquisition, and marked resistance to extinction. The latter results are consistent with the possibility that the unpaired procedure constituted a partial reinforcement procedure in which CO, onset was paired with more extended M exposure on 50% of the trials.

Here we show that the modulation of STDP by a global reward signal leads to reinforcement learning. We first derive analytically learning rules involving reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent synaptic and intrinsic plasticity, by applying a reinforcement learning algorithm to the stochastic spike response model of spiking neurons. These rules have several features common to plasticity mechanisms experimentally found in the brain. We then demonstrate in simulations of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons the efficacy of two simple learning rules involving modulated STDP. One rule is a direct extension of the standard STDP model (modulated STDP), and the other one involves an eligibility trace stored at each synapse that keeps a decaying, memory of the relationships between the recent pairs of preand postsynaptic spike pairs (modulated STDP with eligibility trace). This latter rule permits learning even if the reward signal is delayed. The proposed rules are able to solve the XOR problem with both ratecoded and temporally coded input and to learn a target output firing-rate pattern. These learning rules are biologically plausible, may be used for training generic artificial spiking neural networks, regardless of the neural model used, and suggest the experimental investigation in animals of the existence of reward-modulated STDP.",,,,"Florian, Razvan Valentin/I-7321-2019; Florian, Razvan/A-1033-2010","Florian, Razvan Valentin/0000-0002-4181-4727; Florian, Razvan/0000-0002-4181-4727",,,,,,,,,,,,0899-7667,1530-888X,,,,JUN,2007,19,6,,,,,1468,1502,,10.1162/neco.2007.19.6.1468,,,,,,,WOS:000246262300002,17444757,,,,,

This study incorporated and evaluated the conceptual proposal of the Integrated Model of Everyday Satisfaction. The structure of this model is based on the Niaura's Dynamic Regulator), Model and the Social Learning Theory that included the classical conditioning, the operant and the vicar to explain the dependent-consumption and incorporated some of the criticisms to the different cognitive-behavioral models, as the need to measure, by means of a direct observation, the specific type of skills used by the consumption-dependent users when facing everyday situations; as well as identifying changes of the functioning of the variables making up the model at the moment of turning towards abstinence; it also considered the indicators that the variable everyday satisfaction has been poorly studied and not been included in the study of conceptual models. Thus, the proposed conceptual model: Integrated Model of Everyday Satisfaction, included the following variables: consumption, precipitators, self-efficacy, everyday satisfaction, as well as variables measuring the facing of specific situations: communication, problem-solving, refusal of consumption, depression and anxiety. These variables were evaluated in an intentional, non-probabilistic sample with 20 dependent users of addictive substances, before and after the cognitive-behavioral intervention adapted to the Mexican population. This intervention model included the following components: Functional Analysis, Demonstration of Non-Consumption, Daily Life Goals, Communication, Problem Solving, Consumption Refusal, Marriage Guidance, Employment Searches, Recreational and Social Skills, Emotional Self-Control and Prevention of Relapses. The pre-post-test evaluation methods were: Retrospective Baseline, Situational Confidence Scale and/or Drug Consumption Self Confidence Scale, Daily Life Satisfaction Scale, Inventories of Drug Consumption Situations and/or Inventories of Alcohol Consumption Situations, Beck's Inventories for Depression and Anxiety. Occurrence records were used to assess the video-filmed behavioral assays of consumption refusal, problem-solving and communication. The didactic techniques used in the training were: verbal instruction, modeling, behavioral trials and feedback. In the scaled analysis, the Model showed, at the moment of consumption, solidity accounting for 95% of the variance. At this moment, significantly related to the variables: risk situations, self-efficacy to avoid consumption, everyday satisfaction and anxiety Dependent consumers, showed bigger diversity and intensity of risk situations previously associated to consumption, reduction of facing skills that caused their insecurity to refuse consumption, increased of their physical symptoms of anxiety and decreased of everyday satisfaction related with their poor functioning in different areas of daliy living. The increase of anxiety was an indicator of manifested abstinence syndrome, and confirmed that the used filter criterion, showed sensitivity to attract target population; in turn, anxiety as precipitator confirmed, was sustained by the conditioned withdrawal model. Refusal of consumption, communication and problem-solving at the moment of consumption in the user prior to the training were not significantly associated, indicating the need to acquire and develop these skills in the behavioral repertoire. Eighteen from the twenty dependent users showed in the analysis of interrupted time series, that the amount and frequency of the consumption was significantly changed toward abstinence after their participation in the cognitive-behavioral intervention. The scaled analysis indicates that it was a solid model in terms of abstinence accounting for 96% of the variance. In the final configuration of the Model variables with regard to its proximity to abstinence, identified the proximity between the: decreased of consumption, the more skills for facing risk situations, and refusal of consumption were detected with major proximity; subsequently, more everyday satisfaction and more self-efficacy to avoid consumption; then less anxiety and depression; and eventually, more communication and problem-solving skills. The following variables were significantly associated, during abstinence: the More Everyday Satisfaction from the functioning in daily living, more skills and variety of behavioral alternatives to cope risk situations, more self-efficacy to avoid consumption at coping different risk situations, less anxiety and depression, also more skills to consumption refusal, and decrease of substance consumption. Self-efficacy worked as mediator between behavior and emotion; everyday satisfaction was associated to cognitive variables: self-efficacy and emotional self-control; anxiety and depression. This study detected that it may work as an early advice of relapse, and as antecedent of abstinence. The variables that acted as predictor of abstinence, accounted for 73.2% of the variance and were: coping risk situations with alternative behaviors, getting everyday satisfaction from their performance in activities of different areas of daily living, self-efficacy to resist consumption at risk situations and refusal of consumption in front of persons modeling consumption and invitations and pressure to consume; depression was not significant with the Enter method regression model. The measuring of problem-solving did not include the efficacy of application in everyday life, so that it was not directly associated to consumption. One limitation was not having evaluated the generalization behavior of variables: communication and problem-solving in natural settings; and the lack of physiological measures in order to evaluate the emotional self-control. In another study, it is suggested to assess the variables during follow-up to detect changes in its functioning in this other moment. It may be concluded that the relationship between the diversity of variables inserted in this Model during the organism-environment interaction, is favorable to the abstinence, everyday satisfaction, facing non-consumption, behavior entails, flexibility and integration of a number of cognitive-behavioral skills. The functioning of Everyday Satisfaction as early warning of relapse is an important finding to be considered by the therapist who, when applying the intervention on these users, will have to perform subsequent evaluations of this variable in the process of change in order to anticipate and avoid relapses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0185-3325,,,,,MAY-JUN,2007,30,3,,,,,29,38,,,,,,,,,WOS:000248342100004,,,,,,

Three groups of RLA-I and three of RHA-I rats (1-30, 30-30 and 1-1 groups, the numbers stand for the time spent in the safe compartment during the first and second phase of training) were trained to avoid an electric foot-shock administered in a danger compartment, by running from this compartment to a safe one. Only RLA-I rats showed a significant positive contrast effect, in such a way that the reinforcement increase from the lower (1 s spent in safety) to the higher reward (30 s) led to a response enhancement, surpassing the performance of rats trained with the low (1-1 s) or the high (30-30 s) reward from the beginning of training.

The present study examines further predictions derived from the hypothesis that the withholding of reinforcement induces behaviors akin to depression. We tested for correlations between extinction performance and immobility, as well as between immobility and measures of anxiety in aged and adult rats. Age comparisons were also performed on these variables. Forty aged and 29 adult male Wistar rats (24 and 3 months old, respectively) were examined in the open field, black/white box and elevated-plus maze followed by 6 days of training in the water maze hidden platform task and 8 days of extinction without the platform. Indices of immobility increased over trials of extinction, with the aged showing higher levels, earlier onsets and larger slope increases of immobility than the adults. A lower resistance-to-extinction was predictive of more despair in both age groups. Between-group differences in the open field, black/white box and elevated-plus maze indicated that the aged showed more anxiety-like behavior than the adults and/or explored these environments less. Within the aged group, indicators of fearfulness in the three tests were predictive of higher levels of despair. The extinction-despair model is held to provide the promise of a conceptual and empirical model of human depression that is the consequence of withdrawal of reinforcement. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

When reward is found, replay of recent states experienced prior to discovery of reward is generated as a type of working memory. This acts to reinforces the actions associated with the replayed states, which are necessarily the actions which led to the reward being found, while other competing actions are not reinforced by the replay. On the other hand, actions which are selected but are not reinforced are punished. Here we suggest a firing rate neural network model implementation of this system based on the Basal-Ganglia anatomy with input from a cortical association layer generating replay and auto-catalytic feedback from the dopamine system as a reward signal modulating three-way Hebbian long term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD) at the cortical-striatal synapses. The model is illustrated by numerical simulations of a simple example - that of associating a cue signal to a correct action to obtain reward after a delay period, typical of primate cue reward tasks.

Methods: To test if acute stress reduces reward responsiveness (i.e., the ability to modulate behavior as a function of past reward), a signal-detection task coupled with a differential reinforcement schedule was utilized. Eighty female participants completed the task under both a stress condition, either threat-of-shock (h = 38) or negative performance feedback (h = 42), and a no-stress condition. Results: Stress increased negative affect and anxiety. As hypothesized based on preclinical findings, stress, particularly the threat-of-shock condition, impaired reward responsiveness. Regression analyses indicate that self-report measures of anbedonia predicted stress-induced hedonic deficits even after controlling for anxiety symptoms.

Preclinical studies have not explored this clinical problem. Here, we adapted a reinstatement model ( commonly used to study relapse to abused drugs) to examine the role of stress and anxiety in relapse to palatable food seeking during dieting. Rats were placed on restricted diet (75-80% of daily standard food) and for 12 intermittent training days (9 h/day, every other day) lever-pressed for palatable food pellets (25% fat, 48% carbohydrate) under a fixed ratio 1 (20-s timeout) reinforcement schedule. Subsequently, the rats were given 10 daily extinction sessions during which lever presses were not reinforced, and were then injected with yohimbine (an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist that induces stress and anxiety in humans and non-humans) or given a single food pellet to assess reinstatement of food seeking. The rats rapidly learned to lever press for the palatable pellets and across the training days the ratio of timeout nonreinforced lever presses to reinforced lever presses progressively increased more than three-fold, suggesting the development of compulsive eating behavior. After extinction, yohimbine injections and pellet priming reliably reinstated food seeking. The corticotropin-releasing factor(1) (CRF1) receptor antagonist antalarmin attenuated the reinstatement induced by yohimbine, but not pellet priming. Antalarmin also reversed yohimbine's anxiogenic effects in the social interaction test. These data suggest that CRF is involved in stress-induced relapse to palatable food seeking, and that CRF1 antagonists should be considered for the treatment of maladaptive eating habits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0893-133X,1740-634X,,,,OCT,2006,31,10,,,,,2188,2196,,10.1038/sj.npp.1300964,,,,,,,WOS:000240942900010,16341025,,,,,

We use a supervised learning paradigm to derive a synaptic update rule that optimizes by gradient ascent the likelihood of postsynaptic firing at one or several desired firing times. We find that the optimal strategy of up- and downregulating synaptic efficacies depends on the relative timing between presynaptic spike arrival and desired postsynaptic firing. If the presynaptic spike arrives before the desired postsynaptic spike timing, our optimal learning rule predicts that the synapse should become potentiated. The dependence of the potentiation on spike timing directly reflects the time course of an excitatory postsynaptic potential. However, our approach gives no unique reason for synaptic depression under reversed spike timing. In fact, the presence and amplitude of depression of synaptic efficacies for reversed spike timing depend on how constraints are implemented in the optimization problem. Two different constraints, control of postsynaptic rates and control of temporal locality, are studied.

Here, we examined the mechanisms of endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD) in the dorsal striatum, a brain region critical for motor control and reinforcement learning. Unlike other cell types, strong depolarization of medium spiny neurons was not sufficient to yield detectable endocannabinoid release. However, when paired with postsynaptic depolarization sufficient to activate L-type calcium channels, activation of postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), either by high-frequency tetanic stimulation or an agonist, induced eCB-LTD. Pairing bursts of afferent stimulation with brief subthreshold membrane depolarizations that mimicked down-state to up-state transitions also induced eCB-LTD, which not only required activation of mGluRs and L-type calcium channels but also was bidirectionally modulated by dopamine D-2 receptors. Consistent with network models, these results demonstrate that dopamine regulates the induction of a Hebbian form of long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum.

The model can be interpreted in terms of key elements of Reinforcement Learning Theory. Different neocortical minicolumns represent distinct sensory input states and distinct motor output actions. The dynamics of each minicolumn include separate phases of encoding and retrieval. During encoding, strengthening of excitatory connections forms forward and reverse associations between each state, the following action, and a subsequent state, which may include reward. During retrieval, activity spreads from reward states throughout the network. The interaction of this spreading activity with a specific input state directs selection of the next appropriate action.

Assays for inhalants provide greater opportunities for accurate diagnosis. In addition to known medical consequences of inhalant use (including death), other risks associated with inhalant use and addiction include addiction to other substances, major depression, suicide, and impaired learning and memory.

These factors include: depression, anxiety, loss of sleep, loss of support networks, suicide, violence, injury in fights, homicide, financial debt, divorce, loss of employment, hospitalization, crime and imprisonment, among other. It is therefore required to establish multidisciplinary intervention models that respond to the seriousness of the problem. In Mexico, reports show that there is a need for the development of more intervention models for chronic users of addictive substances, which include systematic implementation and evaluation as well as medium- and long-term measurements to asses effectiveness. Intervention services often do not go beyond support for the initial detoxification. Additionally, the high cost of most treatment schemes makes them inaccessible to the majority of the people affects by these problems. Intervention models must be designed and developed to include elements from other models that have proven to be reliable and effective on the basis of empirical evidence. The Community Reinforcement Approach or CRA intervention model has gained recognition in scientific literature and from international institutions (the National Institute of Drug Addiction, NIDA, and the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, NIAAA) as one of the most effective means in reducing consumption by chronic users of addictive substances. Consequently, the objective of this research was to use a pilot project to adapt, systemize, implement and assess the impact of the Community Reinforcement Approach intervention model in reducing consumption patterns among chronic dependent users of alcohol and other drugs within the Mexican population. A cognitive-behavioral intervention model was applied to 9 chronic users who had requested psychological help at the Psychological Service Centers of the Faculty of Psychology. The average age of the users was 35. Seven of them were male and two female. The most commonly consumed addictive substance was alcohol by six users, with other drugs accounting for three (benzodiazepine, marihuana, cacaine, solvents and amphetamines). On average, the subjects had spent 14 years in schooling. Five of them were single, one was married, on cohabiting and two divorced. With regard to the occupations of the sample, one was a student, two had abandoned a course of study, four were employed before treatment and two were unemployed. The criteria that the users had to meet for inclusions in the study were: to be aged 18 or over; to be able to read and write; to have a medium-to-severe level of alcohol dependence corresponding to a range between 22 and 47 points on the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) and/or a substantial-to-severe level of dependence on other drugs of between 11 and 20 points according to the Drug Abuse Questionnaire (DAQ); to consume a quantity of 14 or more measures of alcohol per occasion and/or 20 or more measures per week for men, and 10 or more per occasion or 15 or more per week for women; to have been treated or interned on at least one previous occasion; to suffer consumption-related difficulties in different areas of daily life. The duration of the treatment period was from 15 to 24 sessions, depending on the specific training needs of each user. Sessions lasted 1(1)/(2) hours, and were given twice a week. The methodology used was single case with repetitions and follow-up. The cognitive-behavioral model included the following intervention components: Functional Analysis, Demonstration of Non-Consumption, Daily Life Goals, Communication, Problem Solving, Consumption Refusal, Marriage Guidance, Employment Searches, Recreational and Social Skills and Prevention of Relapses. The didactic techniques used in the training for each of the aforementioned components were: verbal instruction, modeling, behavioral trials and feedback. The original model (CRA) was adapted to include the following changes: 1) More communication skills were integrated, including listening, starting conversations, giving and receiving criticism, giving and receiving recognition, and sharing positive and negative feelings; 2) Relapse prediction variables were assessed: self-effectiveness and triggers; 3) New skills for refusing consumption were added: interrupting interaction, justification for non-consumption. Occurrence records were kept for the application in natural settings of the skills taught. In addition, teaching materials were prepared, along with information brochures on different addictive substances and the different training components, lists of community resources and therapist checklists to guarantee the systematic implementation of the model. The pre-post-test evaluation methods were: Retrospective Baseline (RETBAS), Self-Recording, Situational Confidence Scale and/or Drug Consumption Self-Confidence Scale, Daily Life General Satisfaction Scale, Inventories of Drug Consumption Situation and/or Inventories of Alcohol Consumption Situations. The significant changes identified in this preliminary research were: decreases in consumption patterns during and after treatment, since in the pre-post-test statistical analysis for paired samples the results t= 4.75 p=.001 were obtained in the comparison of baseline and treatment, and t= 4.28 p=.002 in the comparison of the baseline and follow-up; increases in the levels of general satisfaction in daily life following treatment and during follow-up, since in the pre-post-test statistical analysis for paired samples the results t=-3.94 and p=.004 were obtained, and t=-4.03 and p=.004 in the pre-follow-up comparison; increases in levels of self-effectiveness after treatment and during follow-up, since in the pre-post-test statistical analysis for paired samples the results t=-5.08 and p=.001 were obtained, and t=-4.37 and p=.002 in the pre-follow-up comparison; decrease in the number of consumption triggers after treatment and during follow-up, since in the pre-post-test statistical analysis for paired samples the results t=5.80 and p=.000 were obtained, and t=5.3 and p=.001 in the pre-follow-up comparison. As a result of the foregoing, the researchers were able to verify the effectiveness of the intervention model in significantly reducing consumption patterns in nine chronic dependent users of addictive substances. Similarly, the model had a significant impact on consumption prediction variables, as well as increasing self-effectiveness levels and eliminating triggers to avoid relapses. Users learnt how to create a more satisfying day-to-day lifestyle, by including activities incompatible with consumption. Finally, in repetitions of the implementation of this intervention model, it is recommended that a training component be introduced for emotion management (Depression, anxiety and anger), as well as an assessment of cognitive functioning as a relapse prediction variable, and the participation of users that have been part of a social-recreational activity group to reinforce sustained abstinence in the long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0185-3325,,,,,FEB,2005,28,1,,,,,61,71,,,,,,,,,WOS:000228366900007,,,,,,

Moreover, factors of smoking motivation have been identified, which describe incentives to smoke and types of smoking behavior. The most frequently reported motives are psychosocial smoking, sensorimotor smoking, indulgent smoking, stimulation smoking, sedation smoking, dependent smoking, and automatic smoking. In the first phase after the start of smoking, psychosocial smoking is the dominating motive, which is best represented by theories of social psychology. Sensorimotor smoking may be best explained by theories of classical and operant conditioning. Indulgent smoking (= smoking for pleasure) may be explained by neurochemical theories and by the neurobiological theories of dependence emphasizing nicotine-induced activation of mesolimbic dopaminergic reinforcement. Stimulation smoking and sedation smoking are related to arousal models. Moreover, sedation smoking is also explained by aspects of reducing negative affect (as claimed by theories of affect regulation) and by biochemical theories emphasizing serotonergic mechanisms in modulating anxiety as well as by theories of dependence. Dependent smoking, which is mostlt based on negative reinforcement (suppression of withdrawal symptoms) may be explained by neurocheimcal theories as well as by neurobiological theories of psychological and physical dependence explaining blunted dopan-tinergic and serotonergic responsivity as due to desensitization of respective receptors.

According to J.A. Gray's theory, non-reinforcement activates the behavioural inhibition system which in turn causes anxiety. As predicted, anxiolytic drugs including benzodiazepines affect the operant extinction process. Recent studies have shown that reducing GABA-mediated neurotransmission retards extinction of aversive conditioning. We have shown in a series of studies that anxiolytic compounds that potentiate GABA facilitate extinction of positively reinforced fixed-ratio operant behaviour in C57B1/6 male mice. This effect does not occur in the early stages of extinction, nor is it dependent on cumulative effects of the compound administered. Potentiation of GABA at later stages has the effect of increasing sensitivity to the extinction contingency and facilitates the inhibition of the behaviour that is no longer required. The GABAergic hypnotic, zolpidem, has the same selective effects on operant extinction in this procedure. The effects of zolpidem are not due to sedative action. There is evidence across our series of experiments that different GABA-A subtype receptors are involved in extinction facilitation and anxiolysis. Consequently, this procedure may not be an appropriate model for anxiolytic drug action, but it may be a useful technique for analysing the neural bases of extinction and designing therapeutic interventions in humans where failure to extinguish inappropriate behaviours can lead to pathological conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

For a biological neural network, such a gradient computation would be difficult to implement, because of the complex dynamics of intrinsic and synaptic conductances in neurons. Here we show that irregular spiking similar to that observed in biological neurons could be used as the basis for a learning rule that calculates a stochastic approximation to the gradient. The learning rule is derived based on a special class of model networks in which neurons fire spike trains with Poisson statistics. The learning is compatible with forms of synaptic dynamics such as short-term facilitation and depression. By correlating the fluctuations in irregular spiking with a reward signal, the learning rule performs stochastic gradient ascent on the expected reward. It is applied to two examples, learning the XOR computation and learning direction selectivity using depressing synapses. We also show in simulation that the learning rule is applicable to a network of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1539-3755,1550-2376,,,,APR,2004,69,4,1,,,,,,41909,10.1103/PhysRevE.69.041909,,,,,,,WOS:000221252100046,15169045,,,,,

In the present study, in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profiles of R278995/CRA0450 were investigated. R278995/CRA0450 showed high affinity for recombinant and native CRF1 receptors without having affinity for the CRF2 receptor. R278995/CRA0450 attenuated CRF-induced cyclic AMP formation in AtT-20 cells and CRF-induced forepaw treading in gerbils, indicating that R278995/CRA0450 is an antagonist of the CRF1 receptor. In addition to CRF1 receptor antagonism, R278995/CRA0450 showed high affinity for the sigma(1) receptor, and attenuated (+)-SKF 10,047-induced head-weaving behavior, suggesting sigma(1) receptor antagonism. R278995/CRA0450 showed dose-dependent in vivo occupancy when assessed by ex vivo receptor binding, indicating good brain penetration. R278995/CRA0450 did not alter spontaneous anxiety when tested in the rat elevated plus maze (up to 3 mg/kg, p.o.) or lick suppression test (up to 10 mg/kg, i.p.). However, potent anxiolytic-like properties were observed in rats subjected to swim stress prior to testing on the elevated plus-maze, indicating activity primarily in tests taxing stress-induced anxiety. R278995/CRA0450 was inactive in mouse tail suspension, rat forced swim and rat differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-s (DRL72), while it showed dose-dependent antidepressant-like effects in the rat learned helplessness paradigm and the olfactory bulbectomy model, demonstrating activity in a subset of animal models of depression associated with subchronic stress exposure. No or only mild effects were seen in tests of locomotor activity, motor coordination and sedation. These results indicate that R278995/CRA0450 is an orally active CRF1 and sigma(1) receptor antagonist with potent anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activities. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This is possible if synapses are hedonistic, responding to a global reward signal by increasing their probabilities of vesicle release or failure, depending on which action immediately preceded reward. Hedonistic synapses learn by computing a stochastic approximation to the gradient of the average reward. They are compatible with synaptic dynamics such as short-term facilitation and depression and with the intricacies of dendritic integration and action potential generation.

It is also determined how well Gray's RST scales predict the surface scales of personality, which were measured in terms of Eysenck Personality Profiler (EPP) scales, the EPQ-R and the learning styles questionnaire (LSQ) scales. First, results suggest that independent pathways of RST scales may exist in humans. Second, Fight seems related to Anxiety and not the Fight/Flight system as proposed by RST. Third. a remarkably consistent story emerges in that Extraversion scales are predicted by Fight, Psychoticism scales are predicted by Active-avoidance, Fight and/or Flight, and Neuroticism scales tend not to be predicted at all (except for Anxiety). Fourth, Gray's revised scales are Unrelated to gender and age effects and show a predictable overlap with the LSQ and original GWPQ scales. It is concluded that Gray's model of personality might provide a stable biological basis of many surface scales of personality, but that there must also be other influences on personality. These results question the finer structure of Gray's RST whilst also showing that RST has greater range of applicability than a strict interpretation of theory implies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Its wiring is deduced from a mathematical constraint, i.e. the necessity, for motor orders processing, to compute an approximate inverse function of the bio-mechanical function of the moving plant, here the bio-mechanics of the eye. This wiring is comparable to the anatomy of the cerebellar pathways. A predicting element, necessary for inversion and thus for movement accuracy, is modeled by an artificial neural network whose structure, deduced from physical constraints expressing the mechanics of the eye, is similar to the cell connectivity of the cerebellar cortex. Its functioning is set by supervised reinforcement learning, according to learning rules aimed at reducing the errors of pointing, and deduced from a differential calculation. After each movement, a teaching signal encoding the pointing error is distributed to various learning sites, as is, in the cerebellum, the signal issued from the inferior olive and conveyed to various cell types by the climbing fibers. Results of simulations lead to predict the existence of a learning site in the glomeruli. After learning, the model is able to accurately simulate saccadic eye movements. It accounts for the function of the cerebellar pathways and for the final integrator of the oculomotor system. The novelty of this model of movement control is that its structure is entirely deduced from mathematical and physical constraints, and is consistent with general anatomy, cell connectivity and functioning of the cerebellar pathways. Even the learning rules can be deduced from calculation, and they reproduce long term depression, the learning process which takes place in the dendritic arborization of the Purkinje cells. This approach, based on the laws of mathematics and physics, appears thus as an efficient way of understanding signal processing in the motor system.

Group treatment may reduce the sense of isolation experienced by anxious teenagers, who may assume that others do not share their distress. Unfortunately, groups are a poorly studied treatment modality in this population. This article describes our clinical experience with mixed-gender groups of young adolescents, aged 12 to 15 years, with a diagnosed DSM-IV anxiety disorder (separation anxiety, overanxious disorder, social phobia, or simple phobia) and treated with a 20-session, manual-based, cognitive-behavioral/ interpersonal group intervention. After a brief review of the relevant literature, developmental issues of early adolescence are examined and their contribution to reducing anxiety is illustrated by using examples from the group. Studies to date have found that cognitive-behavioral group treatment for adolescents with social phobia have shown promising results. Two separate studies found reduction of anxiety symptoms after treatment; one study showed maintenance of treatment effects over 1 year (Albano et al., 1995; Hayward et al., 2000). Barrett's (1998) evaluation of a cognitive-behavioral group family-based intervention for childhood anxiety disorders, including young adolescents (7-14 years), demonstrated treatment efficacy with 64.8% of children no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at 12-month follow-up in comparison with 25.2% of children on a waiting list. Studies suggest the effectiveness of group treatment for anxiety using brief cognitive-behavioral parent/child models and suggest considering developmental and interpersonal contexts in the treatment of anxiety. Indeed, peer and family relationships are important considerations in group work with teenagersand often become a focus of concern as teenagers move toward greater autonomy. Developmental and interpersonal contexts have been cited as important therapeutic factors in adolescent treatment (Grunebaum and Solomon, 1982; Holmbeck et al., 2000). Interpersonal approaches to adolescent group treatment have been discussed by Cramer-Azima (1991), Corder (1994), and Grunebaum and Solomon (1982). Many anxious teenagers report feeling different from their peers and avoid peer interactions, thus reducing opportunities for social development, putting undue pressure on the parent-child relationship, and increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression. In our setting, a cognitive-behavioral/interpersonal group treatment for young adolescents appeared to reduce anxiety symptoms and increase support-seeking coping behaviors on standardized self-report measures (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [Reynolds and Richmond, 1985]; Children's Coping Strategies Checklist [Sandler and Ayers, 1990]). The group addressed developmental issues of early adolescence as well as anxiety-related difficulties. Group treatments provide adolescents with social exposure and peer feedback and the opportunity to practice adaptive behaviors with peers. Cognitive-behavioral approaches for anxiety management and problem solving can be taught within an interpersonal group context, utilizing the here-and-now focus of the group to optimize opportunities for modeling, social reinforcement, identification, and skill-building (Satterfield, 1994). Factors that may have contributed to the reduction in adolescents' anxiety symptoms will now be illustrated. Anxiety management training is presented early in the group, allowing ongoing reinforcement of these cognitive skills throughout die duration of the group. Group interactions that may have contributed to anxiety reduction include cohesion-building activities, psychoeducation, exposure to peer models, opportunities for observational learning, and general group therapeutic factors such as instillation of hope, universality, and cohesion. The group may also function as a transitional social environment, providing a safe forum for social problem solving in a context that mirrors the adolescents' usual social milieu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0890-8567,1527-5418,,,,JUN,2002,41,6,,,,,,,UNSP 0890-5867/02/4106-0739,10.1097/00004583-200206000-00014,,,,,,,WOS:000175744700014,12049449,,,,,

Prominent in these are actor-critic models of basal ganglia functioning, which build on the strong resemblance between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal difference prediction error signal in the critic, and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively review several actor-critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic reproduce the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent to which models of the actor take into account known basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an alternative approach to modeling a critic network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to 'evolve' an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved mechanism to the basic model of the critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such implementations build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of the actor-critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal level with very little detail. We describe an alternative model of the basal ganglia which takes into account several important, and previously neglected, anatomical and physiological characteristics of basal ganglia-thalamocortical connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest that since such selective encoding may bias the representation at the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of the dopamine signal in RL and in behavioral switching. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using evolutionary computation techniques we evolve (near-)optimal neuronal learning rules in a simple neural network model of reinforcement learning in bumblebees foraging for nectar. The resulting neural networks exhibit efficient reinforcement learning, allowing the bees to respond rapidly to changes in reward contingencies. The evolved synaptic plasticity dynamics give rise to varying exploration/exploitation levels and to the well-documented choice strategies of risk aversion and probability matching. Additionally, risk aversion is shown to emerge even when bees are evolved in a completely risk-less environment. In contrast to existing theories in economics and game theory, risk-averse behavior is shown to be a direct consequence of (near-)optimal reinforcement learning, without requiring additional assumptions such as the existence of a nonlinear subjective utility function for rewards. Our results are corroborated by a rigorous mathematical analysis, and their robustness in real-world situations is supported by experiments in a mobile robot. Thus we provide a biologically founded, parsimonious, and novel explanation for risk aversion and probability matching.",,,,"Ruppin, Eytan/R-9698-2017","Ruppin, Eytan/0000-0002-7862-3940",,,,,,,,,,,,1059-7123,1741-2633,,,,,2002,10,1,,,,,5,24,,10.1177/10597123020101001,,,,,,,WOS:000182027000001,,,,,,

Parkinson's disease (PD) provides a model to assess their implications in humans. The aims of the study were to investigate motivation and sensitivity to reinforcement in non-demented and -depressed PD patients and to evaluate the influence of dopaminergic therapy by comparing patients in on (with L-Dopa) and off' (without L-Dopa) states. Twenty-three PD patients were compared, in both the on and off' states, to 28 controls, using: (1) an Apathy Scale; (2) Stimulus-Reward Learning, Reversal, and Extinction tasks; and (3) a Gambling task. PD patients were found: (1) mildly apathetic; (2) impaired on Stimulus-Reward Learning and Reversal, but not on Extinction; and (3) able to progress in the Gambling task during the first, but not the second assessment. There was no significant correlation between these various deficits. L-Dopa treatment clearly improved motivation, but had more limited and contrasting effects on other variables, decreasing the number of omission errors in Reversal, but increasing the number of perseveration errors in Extinction. These results suggest: (1) an implication of striatofrontal loops in human motivation and explicit and implicit sensitivity to reinforcement; (2) a positive influence Of L-Dopa treatment on the subjective evaluation of motivation, but contrasting effects on reward sensitivity.

Investigations about motivation also stimulate many scientists and constitute another foundation of this study (13). The level of performance depends on knowledge and motivation (33). Time devoted to study is essential to succeed; so motivation and procrastination are in competition. The importance of reinforcement (extrinsical motivation) and the desire for learning and knowing (intrinsical motivation) are determinant Other elements must be emphasized: guarantee of obtaining rewards, self efficacy and causal attribution. These considerations point out the multidimensional and interactive aspects of test anxiety (7,31). The number of components is not described unanimously but experts agree with emotional, cognitive and behavioral dimensions (25). So, anxiety was approached in its motivational properties, and it was the case until the sixties, in terms of drive corresponding to a need like thirst or hunger (18); then it was conceptualized in a dynamic context broader than that of stress and coping (29,30). Last, it constitutes the object of theories highlighting cognitive interference (9,23,26) or defective skills (8,32). A lot of questionnaires were built without answering the different aspects and for instance without linking the theoretical and therapeutic components concerning this problem. Committed to the traditional fields of research (test anxiety and need of achievement), to Weiner's work about attribution theory (34) and that of Bandura in self efficacy (4,5), E Depreeuw (10) was particularly interested in Heckhausen's model (16,17), trying to associate experimental conceptions with the clinical reality. On this basis, he elaborated the TASTE (10,12,20): test for ability to study and evaluation. At first constituted of 121 items, the self-questionnaire, after factorial analysis, was reduced to 78 items assessing 4 factors which represent the 8 components of Heckhausen's model (16). The first factor (30 items) concerns anxiety in its emotional and cognitive characteristics. Interesting data were observed by Depreeuw and confirmed in the Netherlands and in Greece (19), especially the fact that anxiety of girls is higher than that of boys when they are confronted with an exam. The second one (19 items) represents self-confidence : confidence in ability to succeed and on using adequate strategies. The third factor (14 items) squared withvalue attributed to performance. It especially comments on the intrinsical component of motivation, The fourth factor (15 items) corresponds to procrastination; study is postponed on behalf of activities which actually reduce the achievement process. The self-report questionnaire (where answers run from total disagreement to total agreement whether they correspond to the way of thinking or acting) takes account of the emotional, cognitive and behavioral dimensions of the model, The multidimensional aspect of this questionnaire, but mainly its connections with theory and clinic, are convincing; we adopted it with other tests in research about fear of failure. Validation of the French translation is the subject of this article. In order to realize this operation, we chose the initial version of TASTE (121 items) to assess a Belgian sample of french speaking students in the first year of University of Liege (n = 617). They are differenciated by gender, faculty (Economy, Medecine, Philosophy, Psychology, Applied Sciences) and experience of failure, i.e. the fact of repeating a school year. Statistics were realized with SPSS and SAS. A comprehension test and a back translation are satisfactory. The stability over time too: the one week test-retest was achieved with a sample of 33 student nurses; comparing the factors two by two, intra-class correlations ranged from 0,5 to 0,95. The component analysis with Varimax rotation does not allow us to find the four factors of construction. We obtain the same disappointing results with the version of 78 items. According to the screentest, we adopted the solution of five factors which confirms the original construction. A fifth particularly strong factor (Cronbach's alpha 0,82) corresponds to devalonsation. The intemal reliability is very satisfactory. If we consider the items strong loading (more than 0,30), the French version is constituted of 94 items. If we consider the items which are specifically loading each factor, we can reduce the questionnaire to 50 items. Internal reliability remains the same, Correlations between the data obtained with this brief version are satisfactory; comparing the factors in pairs. Pearson's coefficients range from 0,8 to 0,89. The study of E Depreeuw was realized ten years ago with a Belgian sample of Flemish-speaking students; is the cultural context or an evolution in test anxiety which explains such a difference in the results ? We are now assessing a sample in another country which used the TASTE in 1996 in order to have some information about comparison of samples. In any case, the questionnaire of E. Depreeuw respects the multidimensional aspect of test anxiety. Our choice of 5 factors according to principal components confirms the original structure of the test but also discriminates another factor which could be predictive of psychopathology (panic, depression). This new dimension measures negative perception of ability and achievement especially when compared with other students. One aim of such a study is to discern clusters of students i.e. groups of students with characteristics such as Covington (7), Depreeuw (20) and Zeidner (35) describe them. This description is very important; the French version is only a part of a very broader study including other tests and could differenciate student's profiles. The French version of 5 factors finally gives results in agreement with the original. The items (10 per factor) are selected according to their highest specificity and after elimination of redundancy. Validity remains in the short version, making it more useful in clinical practice.",,,,"Pereira, Anabela/I-5400-2014","Pereira, Anabela/0000-0002-3897-2732",,,,,,,,,,,,0013-7006,,,,,NOV-DEC,2001,27,6,,,,,527,538,,,,,,,,,WOS:000174170900003,11865560,,,,,

Long-held assumptions about the lack of inter-personal understanding and impulsiveness continue to play a central role in clinical assessment and intervention for this group. Yet, there is a lack of controlled studies indicating the influence of such factors in frequent aggression. The dominant behavioural tradition has long encouraged such assumptions, but has focused on people with more severe disabilities where such assumptions are arguably more appropriate. The current review of the literature shows a clear evolution away from a strict behavioural approach towards cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches that take account of the heterogeneous psychosocial causes of aggression. We find support for CBT in the child-development literature, which examines inter-personal difficulties from an information-processing perspective. Finally, we argue that much of the literature implicitly utilizes the concept of self, and we suggest that this should be made explicit in a reformulated theory of the 'person', incorporating the self concept and embedding individual cognitive processes and behaviour in a social context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-1129,,,,,SEP,2001,74,,3,,,,305,321,,10.1348/000711201161000,,,,,,,WOS:000171230100003,11589324,,,,,

Recent experiments have shown that dopamine neurons are not directly modulated in relation to movements. Rather, they appear to code the rewarding aspects of environmental stimuli. They show short, phasic increases of activity following primary food and liquid rewards (unconditioned stimuli) and conditioned, reward-predicting stimuli of visual, auditory, and somatosensory modalities. They also display smaller activation-depression sequences after stimuli resembling rewards and after novel or particularly intense stimuli. Rewards are only reported as far as they occur differently than predicted. According to learning theories, a prediction error message may constitute a powerful teaching signal for behavior and learning. The phasic reward message is different from the more tonic enabling function of dopamine that is deficient in Parkinson's disease, indicating that dopamine neurons subserve different functions at different time scales. Neurons in other brain structures, such as the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala, code the quality, quantity, and preference of rewards.

Four waves of prospective, longitudinal data from a community sample followed from adolescence into young adulthood were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were used to test the effects of differential associations, definitions, differential reinforcement, and changes in adult role status on smoking cessation in young adulthood. Becoming married to a nonsmoker and decreases in the proportion of friends who smoked were significant predictors of cessation. Current smokers and stoppers did not differ significantly in terms of prior intensity of cigarette use or alcohol abuse/dependence. They also did not differ in terms of psychological characteristics, including depression and prior coping use of cigarettes. Social networks were more important than social roles for predicting cessation in young adulthood. Thus, smoking cessation programs should focus on social learning processes.

The adaptation is driven by the spontaneous fluctuations in the system input and output, the covariance of which provides useful information about the changes in the system behavior. The control structure represents a novel form of associative reinforcement learning in which the reinforcement signal is implicitly given by the covariance of the input-output (I/O) signals. Theoretical foundations for the paradigm are derived using Lyapunov theory and are verified by means of computer simulations. The learning algorithm is applicable to a general class of nonlinear adaptive control problems, This on-line direct adaptive control method benefits from a computationally straightforward design, proof of convergence, no need for complete system identification, robustness to noise and uncertainties, and the ability to optimize a general performance criterion in terms of system states and control signals.

Gray's personality theory: a commentary on Matthews and Gilliland (1999),PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"In their comparative review of H. J. Eysenck's arousal and J. A. Gray's reinforcement theories of personality, Matthews and Gilliland [(1999) Personality and Individual Differences, 26, 583-626] concluded that Cognitive constructs may be more appropriate than biological ones for explaining the majority of behaviours, so that explanations of the kind offered by the Eysenck and Gray theories are relevant to a restricted range of phenomena only (p. 620). In this commentary, I address a number of problems in Gray's account of the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioural Approach System (BAS) that need to be tackled before we can conclude that cognitive accounts of personality should supersede, rather than complement, biologically-based ones. I focus on two broad sets of issues. (1) Practical (operational) problems, that call for further experimental work, relating to: (a) BIS/BAS and conditioning/learning; (b) reinforcement parameters (i.e., defining reward/punishment, reinforcement expectancies, schedules of reward, sources of reinforcement, cues versus feedback); and (c) psychometric measures of BIS/BAS functioning. (2) The theoretical nature of BIS/BAS effects, that call for an elaboration of Gray's theory. I propose a two-process model that postulates that the BIS and BAS exert two effects: facilitatory, the BIS mediates responses to aversive stimuli, the BAS to appetitive stimuli; and antagonistic, the BIS and BAS impair responses mediated by the alternate reinforcement system. Specific directions for future research are given. I conclude that, in several crucial respects, Gray's reinforcement theory has yet to be adequately tested; and that closer attention to operational definitions, and the mutual interplay of the BIS and BAS, may enhance its experimental precision.

These changes lead to impairment in the mechanisms that mediate positive reinforcement and the emergence of affective changes such as anxiety, dysphoria, and depression during withdrawal. Considerable evidence exists implicating perturbations in DA and 5-HT transmission in the nucleus accumbens-neurochemical systems that are activated by cocaine and ethanol self-administration and deficient daring withdrawal-as potential substrates for these affective changes. rn addition, growing evidence suggests that enhanced CRF release in the central nucleus of the amygdala represents a mechanism underlying the anxiogenic and stress-tike consequences of withdrawal that are common to all drugs of abuse. A growing body of evidence also implicates dysregulation of the non-neuroendocrine CRF stress system within the central nucleus of the amygdala as a common factor in the anxiogenic and aversive consequences of withdrawal from drugs of abuse. Moreover, a possible link may exist between long-lasting abnormalities in CRF function in the CeA and vulnerability to relapse during protracted abstinence. Another presumably critical element contributing to the chronic relapsing nature of drug addiction is the learned responses to drug-related stimuli. The long-lasting efficacy of drug- and alcohol-associated contextual stimuli in eliciting drug-seeking behavior in animal models of relapse resembles the endurance of conditioned cue reactivity and cue-induced cocaine craving in humans and confirms a significant role of learning factors in the long-lasting addictive potential of cocaine. With cocaine, DI-dependent neural mechanisms within the medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala may be important substrates for the motivating effects of drug-related environmental stimuli. With ethanol, available data suggest a role for opioid receptors in the mediation of conditioned drug-seeking behavior. Finally, conditioning factors (i.e., exposure to drug-associated stimuli) and stress can interact to augment vulnerability to relapse. This finding emphasizes that it will be important to consider the simultaneous effects of multiple environmental triggers for relapse in the development of treatment and medication strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0077-8923,,1-57331-303-3; 1-57331-302-5,,,,2001,937,,,,,,1,26,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03556.x,,,,,,,WOS:000172010800001,11458532,,,,,
,,J,"Watt, MC; Stewart, SH",,,,"Watt, MC; Stewart, SH",,,Anxiety sensitivity mediates the relationships between childhood learning experiences and elevated hypochondriacal concerns in young adulthood,JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Objective: The present study investigated childhood learning experiences potentially associated with the development of elevated hypochondriacal concerns in a non-clinical young adult sample, and examined the possible mediating roles of anxiety sensitivity (i.e., fear of anxiety-related symptoms) and trait anxiety (i.e., frequency of anxiety symptoms) in explaining these relationships. Method: 197 university students participated in a retrospective assessment of their childhood instrumental (i.e., parental reinforcement) and vicarious (i.e., parental modeling) learning experiences with respect to arousal-reactive (e.g., dizziness) and arousal-non-reactive (e.g., lumps) bodily symptoms, respectively. Childhood learning experiences were assessed using a revised version of the Learning History Questionnaire (LHQ), anxiety sensitivity levels with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), trait anxiety levels with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T) scale, and degree of hypochondriacal concerns with the Illness Attitudes Scale (IAS)-Total score. Results: Consistent with earlier findings [Watt MC, Stewart SH, Cox BJ. A retrospective study of the learning history origins of anxiety sensitivity. Behav Res Ther 1998;36:505-25.]. elevated anxiety sensitivity levels were associated with increased instrumental and vicarious learning experiences related to both arousal-reactive and arousal-non-reactive bodily symptoms. Similarly, individuals with elevated hypochondriacal concerns also reported both more instrumental and vicarious learning experiences around bodily symptoms than did students with lower levels of such concerns. However, contrary to the hypothesis, the childhood learning experiences related to hypochondriacal concerns were not specific to arousal-nonreactive symptoms, but instead involved parental reinforcement and modeling of bodily symptoms in general (arousal-reactive and -non-reactive symptoms alike). Anxiety sensitivity, but not trait anxiety, partially mediated the relationships between childhood learning experiences and elevated hypochondriacal concerns in young adulthood. Conclusions: Elevated anxiety sensitivity appears to be a risk factor for the development of hypochondriasis when learning experiences have involved both arousal-reactive and arousal-non-reactive bodily symptoms.

Two computerized versions of the go/no-go discrimination task used by Newman et al. [Newman, J. P., Widom, C. S., & Nathan, S. (1985). Passive avoidance in syndromes of disinhibition: psychopathy and extraversion, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48, 1316-1327]. were administered to groups classified according to extraversion and neuroticism. The results showed that, unlike the work with males, condition R+P (situation involving cues for both reward and punishment) did not produce differences in passive avoidance errors (PAEs) between (neurotic) extraverts and (stable) introverts. In contrast, neurotic introverts tended to make more PAEs than the other groups but only when condition R+P was performed first. With regard to condition P (situation involving only cues for punishment), results showed that stable extraverts tended to display behavioural disinhibition when condition P was performed in second place. These results suggest that disinhibition is a complex phenomenon that may be mediated by either BIS hypoactivity, BAS hyperactivity or even BIS hyperactivity, and by the interaction of all these mechanisms with the involvement of some of the variables such as gender, personality, motivation, task and subject's anxiety state.

The computational models enable a microrobot to learn to track a moving object and anticipate future positions using a CCD camera. The architecture features pre-processing modules for coordinate transformation and instantaneous orientation extraction. Learning of motor control is implemented using predictive Hebbian reinforcement-learning algorithm in the basal ganglia model. Learning of sensory predictions makes use of a combination of long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) adaptation rules within the cerebellum model. The basal ganglia model uses the visual inputs to develop sensorimotor mapping for motor control, while the cerebellum module uses robot orientation and world-coordinate transformed inputs to predict the location of the moving object in a robot centered coordinate system. We propose several hypotheses about the functional role of cell, populations in the cerebellum and argue that mossy fiber projections to the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) could play a coordinate ransformation role and act as gain fields. We propose that such transformation could be learnt early in the brain development stages and could be guided by the activity of the climbing fibers. Proprioceptor mossy fibers projecting to the DCN and providing robot orientation with respect to a reference system could be involved in this case. Other mossy fibers carrying visual sensory input provide visual patterns to the granule cells.

These cells play an important role in reinforcement learning. A neural model explains the key neurophysiological properties of these cells before, during, and after conditioning, as well as related anatomical and neurophysiological data about the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN), lateral hypothalamus, ventral striatum, and striosomes. The model proposes how two parallel learning pathways from limbic cortex to the SNc, one devoted to excitatory conditioning (through the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and PPTN) and the other to adaptively timed inhibitory conditioning (through the striosomes), control SNc responses. The excitatory pathway generates CS-induced excitatory SNc dopamine bursts. The inhibitory pathway prevents dopamine bursts in response to predictable reward-related signals. When expected rewards are not received, striosomal inhibition of SNc that is unopposed by excitation results in a phasic drop in dopamine cell activity. The adaptively timed inhibitory learning uses an intracellular spectrum of timed responses that is proposed to be similar to adaptively timed cellular mechanisms in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These mechanisms are proposed to include metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated Ca2+ spikes that occur with different delays in striosomal cells. A dopaminergic burst in concert with a Ca2+ spike is proposed to potentiate inhibitory learning. The model provides a biologically predictive alternative to temporal difference conditioning models and explains substantially more data than alternative models.",,,,"Brown, Joshua/G-2867-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0270-6474,,,,,DEC 1,1999,19,23,,,,,10502,10511,,,,,,,,,WOS:000083867400031,10575046,,,,,

This task presented two response alternatives and subjects were instructed to earn the maximum number of points. Responses to button 1 were normally followed by an immediate reward(an average gain of 7.5 points). Responses to button 2 were always followed by a punishment (an average loss of 20 points), but caused the next-but-one press on button 1 tc, give am average gain of 115 points. Thus, subjects were required to learn and maintain this counter-conditioning association. Four groups of subjects were formed according to the scores on the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward scales (which are measures of individual differences of Gray's anxiety and impulsivity personality dimensions, respectively). A 69.2% of subjects learned and maintained the counter-conditioning association. As predicted, personality results confirmed that subjects with lower scores on the Sensitivity to Punishment scale learned the counter-conditioning association better and faster when compared with high scorers, Results are consistent with Gray's Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) model of anxiety which holds that individual differences in anxiety may relate to the ability to associate aversive stimuli with a future reward. Assuming that anxiety depends on BIS functioning, our results show that high trait anxious subjects, if compared with low anxious ones, would have a lower ability for associating an aversive event with a later appetitive one. This learning process would serve non-anxious subjects to reduce the aversiveness of cues of punishment and to cope better with stressful situations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

,,J,"Hatfield, J; Job, RFS",,,,"Hatfield, J; Job, RFS",,,Random yoking: An alternative to feedback procedures for preventing superstition in the human learned helplessness paradigm,LEARNING AND MOTIVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"The learned helplessness model of human depression requires that humans demonstrate deficits similar to animals following exposure to noncontingent events. However, the feedback procedure usually employed in the triadic instrumental induction phase represents a confound in studies of the interference effect in humans. Matute (1994) concluded that the feedback procedure is necessary for the interference effect, which is thus due to feedback induced failure rather than learned helplessness. As an alternative, we hypothesize that feedback alerts participants to noncontingency, such that subsequent interference is not inconsistent with learned helplessness theory. The present study evaluates these competing claims by incorporating a never manipulation designed to promote the perception of noncontingency in Mature's (1994) triadic no-feedback-procedure induction. A second noncontingent yoked group received the same tones as the usual direct yoked group, but in random order so as to disrupt the late trials distribution of short-latency tones which promotes superstitious responding. As predicted, the random-yoking procedure inhibited superstition. The interference effect was observed in the random-yoked but not the direct-yoked triad. Thus random-yoked participants may have developed the expectation of noncontingency which is critical to learned helplessness. It is concluded that the confounded feedback procedure is not necessary for the interference effect and should be avoided in future research.

The present study involved a conceptual replication of Ehlers' (1993, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 31, 269-278) study on childhood learning experiences and panic attacks, but also extended her work by investigating the relationship between early learning experiences and the development of AS, in a non-clinical sample. A sample of 551 university students participated in a retrospective assessment of their childhood and adolescent instrumental and vicarious learning experiences with respect to somatic symptoms (i.e. anxiety and cold symptoms, respectively) using an expanded version of Ehler's (1993) Learning History Questionnaire. AS levels were assessed using the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, and panic history was obtained using the Panic Attack Questionnaire, Revised. Contrary to hypotheses, the learning experiences of high AS individuals were not found to be specific to anxiety symptoms, but involved parental reinforcement of sick-role behavior related to somatic symptoms in general. High AS subjects reported both more anxiety and cold symptoms prior to age 18 than individuals with lower levels of AS. In addition, both cold and anxiety symptoms elicited more special attention and/or instructions from parents for high AS individuals to take special care of themselves. These findings are contrasted with the results for self-reported panickers who reported more learning experiences (modeling and parental reinforcement) specific to anxiety-related symptoms, than the non-panickers. The results suggest that higher-than-normal levels of AS may arise from learning to catastrophize about the occurrence of bodily symptoms in general, rather than anxiety-related symptoms in particular.

In the OB rats, BIMT 17, given once daily for 14 consecutive days at an IP dose of 10 mg/kg, but not of 20 mg/kg, reduced the increase in ambulation of OB rats, 24 h after the last administration. In the DRL 72-s test, BIMT 17 had a different profile than imipramine. A single IP injection of 5,? 10, 15 or 20 mg/kg, BIMT 17, in contrast to the same doses of imipramine, did not affect response and reinforcement rate in DRL 72-s 1 h after the administration.

Traditional views of the functioning of the basal ganglia are based on their biomedical importance in disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Their contribution to normal brain functions has remained poorly understood. Experimental investigations over the past few decades have produced a wealth of detailed information about the structure of the basal ganglia and the physiological properties of their component neurones. It has become evident that the basal ganglia play a role in the selection and performance of learnt behaviours, and also in the effects of reinforcement on acquisition and maintenance of new behaviours. At present it is difficult to link the symptoms of basal ganglia disorders to these basic facts, in part because very few theoretical models attempt to incorporate the information that is now available. Computational modelling can help to advance theoretical understanding in this area by establishing explicit links between different levels of organization: from the effects of neurotransmitters such as dopamine on synaptic plasticity, through the dynamic interactions within subpopulations of neurons, to system-level interactions between the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The aim of this review is to outline existing knowledge of the basal ganglia in relation to previous computer modelling work, and to suggest ways of making use of the new experimental findings in the next generation of models.",,,,"Wickens, Jeffery R/N-6055-2014","Wickens, Jeffery R/0000-0002-8795-1209",,,,,,,,,,,,0954-898X,1361-6536,,,,NOV,1997,8,4,,,,,R77,R109,,10.1088/0954-898X/8/4/001,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YK20200001,,,,,,
,,J,"Pennartz, CMA",,,,"Pennartz, CMA",,,Reinforcement learning by Hebbian synapses with adaptive thresholds,NEUROSCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"A central problem in learning theory is how the vertebrate brain processes reinforcing stimuli in order to master complex sensorimotor tasks. This problem belongs to the domain of supervised learning, in which errors in the response of a neural network serve as the basis for modification of synaptic connectivity in the network and thereby train it on a computational task. The model presented here shows how a reinforcing feedback can modify synapses in a neuronal network according to the principles of Hebbian learning. The reinforcing feedback steers synapses towards long-term potentiation or depression by critically influencing the rise in postsynaptic calcium, in accordance with findings on synaptic plasticity in mammalian brain. An important feature of the model is the dependence of modification thresholds on the previous history of reinforcing feedback processed by the network. The learning algorithm trained networks successfully on a task in which a population vector in the motor output was required to match a sensory stimulus vector presented shortly before. In another task, networks were trained to compute coordinate transformations by combining different visual inputs. The model continued to behave well when simplified units were replaced by single-compartment neurons equipped with several conductances and operating in continuous time. This novel form of reinforcement learning incorporates essential properties of Hebbian synaptic plasticity and thereby shows that supervised learning can be accomplished by a learning rule similar to those used in physiologically plausible models of unsupervised learning. The model can be crudely correlated to the anatomy and electrophysiology of the amygdala, prefrontal and cingulate cortex and has predictive implications for further experiments on synaptic plasticity and learning processes mediated by these areas.

,,J,"Poon, CS",,,,"Poon, CS",,,Self-tuning optimal regulation of respiratory motor output by Hebbian covariance learning,NEURAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The respiratory motor system is a specialized musculoskeletal system that is controlled by a small assembly of neuronal clusters in the brainstem. Its prime function is to maintain CO2, O-2, and pH homeostasis in arterial circulation through the motor act of breathing. A longstanding dilemma is that during muscular exercise homeostatic regulation occurs automatically without any apparent feedback or feedforward signals, whereas the homeostasis is readily abolished by exogenous chemical challenge. Recently, it has been proposed that these seemingly incongruous behaviors of the respiratory controller may be a manifestation of self-tuning adaptive control. This hypothesis is supported in part by recent discoveries of various memory systems in the brainstem controller including short- and long-term potentiation and depression of synaptic transmission as well as the dramatic abolishment of homeostatic regulation in mutant mice with targeted genetic disruption of the NMDA receptors. In this paper, we propose a model of self-tuning homeostatic regulation based upon a synaptic adaptation rule-Hebbian covariance learning rule-that has been suggested to underlie many forms of learning and memory in the higher brain. We show that such an adaptation rule may be a useful neuronal substrate for reinforcement learning in optimization tasks. The model demonstrates how spontaneous oscillations and/or random-like fluctuations of neural activity may be exploited by the controller to adaptively regulate and optimize motor output. Such a self-tuning neural control paradigm, which operates without the need for any internal model of the external environment, is generally applicable to a class of steady-state optimal regulation problems with infinite time horizon. An interesting implication of the present results is that brain intelligent control can occur at a subconscious level without the need for voluntary intervention from the higher brain.

These results indicate that TAK-147 ameliorates learning and memory impairment in animal models without affecting the general behavior or causing behavioral depression and suggest that TAK-147 may be useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3565,1521-0103,,,,JUN,1996,277,3,,,,,1292,1304,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UQ52600014,8667190,,,,,

Most research has taken a molar approach to examining relations between these constructs and level of drug use. An experiment examined the roles of affect and expectancies in multiple measures of situation-specific motivation to smoke tobacco. Undergraduate smokers (n = 101) received either a positive or negative mood manipulation (false feedback on an intelligence test). Self-reported urge was influenced by both negative affect and expectancies for positive reinforcement from smoking. Actual consumption was related only to smoking expectancies and only among abstaining smokers. Affect by expectancy Interactions were also found. Findings support a limited role of affect and expectancies in smoking motivation. Poor coherence among the motivational indexes challenges the assumptions of existing models of drug motivation.,,,,,"Wetter, David/0000-0002-6366-0108",,,,,,,,,,,,1064-1297,,,,,FEB,1996,4,1,,,,,29,36,,10.1037/1064-1297.4.1.29,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UL04400005,,,,,,

The results showed: (1) that harm avoidance [as measured by the Personality Questionnaire (TPQ)] predicted aversive CS-UCS associations, while [TPQ] reward dependence predicted appetitive CS-UCS associations (no personality factors predicted neutral CS-UCS associations); and (2) that subjects high in impulsivity [as measured by the IVE scale of the Eysenck Personality Scales (EPS)] showed poor passive avoidance to the aversive-CS, while subjects high in trait anxiety [as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)] showed poor approach behaviour to the appetitive-CS. A correlational study with TPQ and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire [EPQ] factors revealed the structural comparability of these two descriptive systems. The results suggest that associative and instrumental learning under appetitive and aversive conditions do not reflect a general (arousal-based) learning factor, and that specific personality factors mediate reward and punishment in the two stages of learning.

The relationships between speed crossing the maze and anxiety and impulsivity personality traits were explored. Anxiety is hypothesized to reflect a behavioural inhibition system active in punishing environments; and impulsivity, to reflect an activation system active in rewarding environments. Of the measures of impulsivity taken, only one-venturesomeness from the I7-was associated significantly with increased maze crossing speed; this was found particularly in the reward condition and in males. Several anxiety variables were associated with (near-)significant decreases in maze crossing speed in the punishment condition, and in the reward condition during continued testing after maze learning. The coexistence of anxiety and impulsivity correlations, particularly in reward, confirmed predictions that nominal 'punishment' and 'reward' conditions may activate both systems simultaneously. In punishment, prior to successful maze learning, significant anxiety correlations were limited to males, but after maze learning they were confined to females. Neuroticism and extraversion correlated with performance equally well in males; in females the correlation with extraversion was weak. These sex effects are ascribed to differing sources of motivation and to differing properties of EPQ-extraversion for males and females.",,,,,"Pickering, Alan/0000-0002-7301-5321",,,,,,,,,,,,0191-8869,,,,,APR,1995,18,4,,,,,541,558,,10.1016/0191-8869(94)00182-R,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QT55000010,,,,,,

The involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the temporal organization of behavior can be defined by processing units that switch between two stable states of activity (bistable behavior) in response to synaptic inputs. Long-term representation of programs requiring short-term memory can result from activity-dependent modifications of the synaptic transmission controlling the bistable behavior. After learning, the sustained activity of a given neuron represents the selective memorization of a past event, the selective anticipation of a future event, and the predictability of reinforcement. A simulated neural network illustrates the abilities of the model (1) to learn, via a natural step-by-step training protocol, the paradigmatic task (delayed response) used for testing prefrontal neurons in primates, (2) to display the same categories of neuronal activities, and (3) to predict how they change during learning. In agreement with experimental data, two main types of activity contribute to the adaptive properties of the network. The first is transient activity time-lacked to events of the task and its profile remains constant during successive training stages. The second is sustained activity that undergoes nonmonotonic changes with changes in reward contingency that occur during the transition between stages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1047-3211,1460-2199,,,,MAR-APR,1995,5,2,,,,,135,147,,10.1093/cercor/5.2.135,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QP10000004,7620290,,,,,

An important aspect of motor output is its timing in relation to external stimuli or to other components of a movement. Previous studies suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in the timing of movements. Here we describe a neural network model based on the synaptic organization of the cerebellum that can generate timed responses in the range of tens of milliseconds to seconds. In contrast to previous models, temporal coding emerges from the dynamics of the cerebellar circuitry and depends neither on conduction delays, arrays of elements with different time constants, nor populations of elements oscillating at different frequencies. Instead, time is extracted from the instantaneous granule cell population vector. The subset of active granule cells is time-varying due to the granule-Golgi-granule cell negative feedback. We demonstrate that the population vector of simulated granule cell activity exhibits dynamic, nonperiodic trajectories in response to a periodic input. With time encoded in this manner, the output of the network at a particular interval following the onset of a stimulus can be altered selectively by changing the strength of granule --> Purkinje cell connections for those granule cells that are active during the target time window. The memory of the reinforcement at that interval is subsequently expressed as a change in Purkinje cell activity that is appropriately timed with respect to stimulus onset. Thus, the present model demonstrates that a network based on cerebellar circuitry can learn appropriately timed responses by encoding time as the population vector of granule cell activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0899-7667,1530-888X,,,,JAN,1994,6,1,,,,,38,55,,10.1162/neco.1994.6.1.38,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PF90700005,,,,,,
,,J,"RICHARDSON, JS",,,,"RICHARDSON, JS",,,"ON THE FUNCTIONS OF MONOAMINE-OXIDASE, THE EMOTIONS, AND ADAPTATION TO STRESS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Monoamine oxidase is an iron containing enzyme that exists as 2 isozymes, A and B, that have different affinities for various amines as substrates. The activity of monoamine oxidase helps to maintain neuron firing rates throughout the body within homeostatic limits. It does this by metabolizing in the liver bioactive amines absorbed into the bloodstream from food, by metabolizing in the endothelial cells of cerebral vascular microvessels, as part of the blood brain barrier, bioactive amines in the bloodstream, and by metabolizing in the cytoplasm of neurons, molecules of biogenic amine neurotransmitters that are not enclosed in vessicles. Part of the biochemical activity of monoamine oxidase generates hydroxyl radicals, very toxic members of the oxygen free radical group, that may be involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Inhibiting monoamine oxidase with selegiline (I-deprenyl) seems to have neuroprotective actions but this may be due to inducing the release of neuronal growth factors rather than by preventing the formation of free radicals. Other drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase are used to treat patients with atypical depression, panic attacks or post traumatic stress syndrome. It is hypothesized that the emotions act as positive or negative reinforcers of behavior patterns that increase the probability of survival of the organism. The original releasing stimuli for the emotions are related to the basic survival reflexes of the hypothalamus but the emotional response can be easily conditioned to formerly neutral stimuli by association. In the absence of the original releasing stimuli, these learned emotions increase the frequency of survival oriented behavior and decrease the frequency of behavior that jeopardizes survival. The emotional disorders are conditions in which the brain's reinforcement system is inoperative, the person loses contact with reality and the person's behavior bears no relationship to survival. Aversive stimulation evokes a negative emotional response that motivates the organism to escape from the aversive stimulation, and to avoid it, and any conditioned stimuli associated with it, in the future. When the aversive stimulation is inescapable or unavoidable, the organism experiences stress. When the stressful aversive situation is non lethal, survival does not depend on escape but rather on conservation of energy. With repeated exposure, the negative emotional response to the aversive stimulation extinguishes, the organism adapts to the situation and takes on a passive, energy saving behavior pattern. It appears that the post traumatic stress syndrome represents the consequence of prolonged exposure of the organism to excessive aversive stress just as a broken leg represents the consequence of exposure of bone to excessive physical stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-7454,,,,,,1993,70,1-2,,,,,75,84,,10.3109/00207459309000563,,,,,,,WOS:A1993PM31400008,8083027,,,,,

Thus, to evaluate the role of anxiety in this task, the action of these two drugs were compared in the same learning task with a positive or a negative reinforcement. Mice were trained for sessions of ten trials per day for six consecutive days. The sessions during the first three days took place after administration of beta-CCM (0.3 mg/kg), flumazenil (15 mg/kg) or vehicles of these drugs. A negative reinforcement (electric foot-shock) was used in a first experiment, and a positive one (food reward) in a second experiment. Results showed that, whatever the reinforcement, the two drugs enhance learning in a brightness discrimination task. The hypothesis is that flumazenil could have an inverse agonist profile in learning tasks. The question remains as to whether the flumazenil enhancing learning process results from increased arousal and/or anxiogenic factors, or from a negative modulatory influence of endogenous diazepam-like ligands for benzodiazepine receptors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3205,1879-0631,,,,,1991,48,7,,,,,685,692,,10.1016/0024-3205(91)90544-L,,,,,,,WOS:A1991ER51200012,1846660,,,,,
