# meta-analysis_RL

This project contains much of the code which corresponds to the manuscript entitled: 'Reinforcement-learning in mood and anxiety disorders: a simulation meta-analysis', authored by Alexandra C. Pike and Oliver J. Robinson. 
Some R outputs and model fits were too large for github, and users are encouraged to see the OSF repository for these.
